 *
 * The 'size' and 'n_items' values are stashed in the opaque

 *
 * This implementation interprets 'set of pointers' to mean 'array
 * of pointers' but note that nothing in the interface definition
 * precludes an implementation that uses, for example, a linked list.
 * However there should be a small efficiency gain from using an array
 * at lookup time.
 *
 * NOTE	As an optimization, we make our growable array allocations in
 *	powers of two (bytes), since that's how much kmem_alloc (currently)
 *	gives us anyway.  It should save us some free/realloc's ..
 *
 *	As a further optimization, we make the growable array start out
 *	with MIN_N_ITEMS in it.
