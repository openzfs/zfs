/*
 * This file represents the API provided by a vendor to access their
 * offloader. The API can be anything the implementor chooses to
 * expose. There are no limitations on the function signature or
 * name. They just have to be called correctly in the Z.I.A. provider.
 * ZFS and Z.I.A. will not need direct access to any data located on
 * the offloader. Some raw pointers from Z.I.A. will be used directly,
 * but those will always contain information located in memory.
 *
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The kernel offload additionally fakes hardware operations in order
 * to not have to commit actual hardware to the ZFS repository.
 * Offloading data is done by copying data into memory regions outside
 * of ZFS. Offloaded operations are performed by linking back into ZFS
 * and passing kernel_offloader buffers into ZFS functions.
 * kernel_offloader.c conflates the driver and the "physical" device
 * since both memory spaces are in kernel space and run on the
 * CPU. This offloader provides opaque pointers to the provider to
 * simulate handles to inaccessible memory locations. In order to
 * prevent the handle from being dereferenced and used successfully by
 * ZFS or Z.I.A., the handle pointer is masked with a random value
 * generated at load-time. Other offloaders may choose to present
 * non-void handles.
