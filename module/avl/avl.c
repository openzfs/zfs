/*
 * AVL - generic AVL tree implementation for kernel use
 *
 * A complete description of AVL trees can be found in many CS textbooks.
 *
 * Here is a very brief overview. An AVL tree is a binary search tree that is
 * almost perfectly balanced. By "almost" perfectly balanced, we mean that at
 * any given node, the left and right subtrees are allowed to differ in height
 * by at most 1 level.
 *
 * This relaxation from a perfectly balanced binary tree allows doing
 * insertion and deletion relatively efficiently. Searching the tree is
 * still a fast operation, roughly O(log(N)).
 *
 * The key to insertion and deletion is a set of tree manipulations called
 * rotations, which bring unbalanced subtrees back into the semi-balanced state.
 *
 * This implementation of AVL trees has the following peculiarities:
 *
 *	- The AVL specific data structures are physically embedded as fields
 *	  in the "using" data structures.  To maintain generality the code
 *	  must constantly translate between "avl_node_t *" and containing
 *	  data structure "void *"s by adding/subtracting the avl_offset.
 *
 *	- Since the AVL data is always embedded in other structures, there is
 *	  no locking or memory allocation in the AVL routines. This must be
 *	  provided for by the enclosing data structure's semantics. Typically,
 *	  avl_insert()/_add()/_remove()/avl_insert_here() require some kind of
 *	  exclusive write lock. Other operations require a read lock.
 *
 *      - The implementation uses iteration instead of explicit recursion,
 *	  since it is intended to run on limited size kernel stacks. Since
 *	  there is no recursion stack present to move "up" in the tree,
 *	  there is an explicit "parent" link in the avl_node_t.
 *
 *      - The left/right children pointers of a node are in an array.
 *	  In the code, variables (instead of constants) are used to represent
 *	  left and right indices.  The implementation is written as if it only
 *	  dealt with left handed manipulations.  By changing the value assigned
 *	  to "left", the code also works for right handed trees.  The
 *	  following variables/terms are frequently used:
 *
 *		int left;	// 0 when dealing with left children,
 *				// 1 for dealing with right children
 *
 *		int left_heavy;	// -1 when left subtree is taller at some node,
 *				// +1 when right subtree is taller
 *
 *		int right;	// will be the opposite of left (0 or 1)
 *		int right_heavy;// will be the opposite of left_heavy (-1 or 1)
 *
 *		int direction;  // 0 for "<" (ie. left child); 1 for ">" (right)
 *
 *	  Though it is a little more confusing to read the code, the approach
 *	  allows using half as much code (and hence cache footprint) for tree
 *	  manipulations and eliminates many conditional branches.
 *
 *	- The avl_index_t is an opaque "cookie" used to find nodes at or
 *	  adjacent to where a new value would be inserted in the tree. The value
 *	  is a modified "avl_node_t *".  The bottom bit (normally 0 for a
 *	  pointer) is set to indicate if that the new node has a value greater
 *	  than the value of the indicated "avl_node_t *".
 *
 * Note - in addition to userland (e.g. libavl and libutil) and the kernel
 * (e.g. genunix), avl.c is compiled into ld.so and kmdb's genunix module,
 * which each have their own compilation environments and subsequent
 * requirements. Each of these environments must be considered when adding
 * dependencies from avl.c.

/*
 * Small arrays to translate between balance (or diff) values and child indices.
 *
 * Code that deals with binary tree data structures will randomly use
 * left and right children when examining a tree.  C "if()" statements
 * which evaluate randomly suffer from very poor hardware branch prediction.
 * In this code we avoid some of the branch mispredictions by using the
 * following translation arrays. They replace random branches with an
 * additional memory reference. Since the translation arrays are both very
 * small the data should remain efficiently in cache.
