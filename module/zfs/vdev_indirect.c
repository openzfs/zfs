/*
 * An indirect vdev corresponds to a vdev that has been removed.  Since
 * we cannot rewrite block pointers of snapshots, etc., we keep a
 * mapping from old location on the removed device to the new location
 * on another device in the pool and use this mapping whenever we need
 * to access the DVA.  Unfortunately, this mapping did not respect
 * logical block boundaries when it was first created, and so a DVA on
 * this indirect vdev may be "split" into multiple sections that each
 * map to a different location.  As a consequence, not all DVAs can be
 * translated to an equivalent new DVA.  Instead we must provide a
 * "vdev_remap" operation that executes a callback on each contiguous
 * segment of the new location.  This function is used in multiple ways:
 *
 *  - i/os to this vdev use the callback to determine where the
 *    data is now located, and issue child i/os for each segment's new
 *    location.
 *
 *  - frees and claims to this vdev use the callback to free or claim
 *    each mapped segment.  (Note that we don't actually need to claim
 *    log blocks on indirect vdevs, because we don't allocate to
 *    removing vdevs.  However, zdb uses zio_claim() for its leak
 *    detection.)
 */

/*
 * "Big theory statement" for how we mark blocks obsolete.
 *
 * When a block on an indirect vdev is freed or remapped, a section of
 * that vdev's mapping may no longer be referenced (aka "obsolete").  We
 * keep track of how much of each mapping entry is obsolete.  When
 * an entry becomes completely obsolete, we can remove it, thus reducing
 * the memory used by the mapping.  The complete picture of obsolescence
 * is given by the following data structures, described below:
 *  - the entry-specific obsolete count
 *  - the vdev-specific obsolete spacemap
 *  - the pool-specific obsolete bpobj
 *
 * == On disk data structures used ==
 *
 * We track the obsolete space for the pool using several objects.  Each
 * of these objects is created on demand and freed when no longer
 * needed, and is assumed to be empty if it does not exist.
 * SPA_FEATURE_OBSOLETE_COUNTS includes the count of these objects.
 *
 *  - Each vic_mapping_object (associated with an indirect vdev) can
 *    have a vimp_counts_object.  This is an array of uint32_t's
 *    with the same number of entries as the vic_mapping_object.  When
 *    the mapping is condensed, entries from the vic_obsolete_sm_object
 *    (see below) are folded into the counts.  Therefore, each
 *    obsolete_counts entry tells us the number of bytes in the
 *    corresponding mapping entry that were not referenced when the
 *    mapping was last condensed.
 *
 *  - Each indirect or removing vdev can have a vic_obsolete_sm_object.
 *    This is a space map containing an alloc entry for every DVA that
 *    has been obsoleted since the last time this indirect vdev was
 *    condensed.  We use this object in order to improve performance
 *    when marking a DVA as obsolete.  Instead of modifying an arbitrary
 *    offset of the vimp_counts_object, we only need to append an entry
 *    to the end of this object.  When a DVA becomes obsolete, it is
 *    added to the obsolete space map.  This happens when the DVA is
 *    freed, remapped and not referenced by a snapshot, or the last
 *    snapshot referencing it is destroyed.
 *
 *  - Each dataset can have a ds_remap_deadlist object.  This is a
 *    deadlist object containing all blocks that were remapped in this
 *    dataset but referenced in a previous snapshot.  Blocks can *only*
 *    appear on this list if they were remapped (dsl_dataset_block_remapped);
 *    blocks that were killed in a head dataset are put on the normal
 *    ds_deadlist and marked obsolete when they are freed.
 *
 *  - The pool can have a dp_obsolete_bpobj.  This is a list of blocks
 *    in the pool that need to be marked obsolete.  When a snapshot is
 *    destroyed, we move some of the ds_remap_deadlist to the obsolete
 *    bpobj (see dsl_destroy_snapshot_handle_remaps()).  We then
 *    asynchronously process the obsolete bpobj, moving its entries to
 *    the specific vdevs' obsolete space maps.
 *
 * == Summary of how we mark blocks as obsolete ==
 *
 * - When freeing a block: if any DVA is on an indirect vdev, append to
 *   vic_obsolete_sm_object.
 * - When remapping a block, add dva to ds_remap_deadlist (if prev snap
 *   references; otherwise append to vic_obsolete_sm_object).
 * - When freeing a snapshot: move parts of ds_remap_deadlist to
 *   dp_obsolete_bpobj (same algorithm as ds_deadlist).
 * - When syncing the spa: process dp_obsolete_bpobj, moving ranges to
 *   individual vdev's vic_obsolete_sm_object.

/*
 * "Big theory statement" for how we condense indirect vdevs.
 *
 * Condensing an indirect vdev's mapping is the process of determining
 * the precise counts of obsolete space for each mapping entry (by
 * integrating the obsolete spacemap into the obsolete counts) and
 * writing out a new mapping that contains only referenced entries.
 *
 * We condense a vdev when we expect the mapping to shrink (see
 * vdev_indirect_should_condense()), but only perform one condense at a
 * time to limit the memory usage.  In addition, we use a separate
 * open-context thread (spa_condense_indirect_thread) to incrementally
 * create the new mapping object in a way that minimizes the impact on
 * the rest of the system.
 *
 * == Generating a new mapping ==
 *
 * To generate a new mapping, we follow these steps:
 *
 * 1. Save the old obsolete space map and create a new mapping object
 *    (see spa_condense_indirect_start_sync()).  This initializes the
 *    spa_condensing_indirect_phys with the "previous obsolete space map",
 *    which is now read only.  Newly obsolete DVAs will be added to a
 *    new (initially empty) obsolete space map, and will not be
 *    considered as part of this condense operation.
 *
 * 2. Construct in memory the precise counts of obsolete space for each
 *    mapping entry, by incorporating the obsolete space map into the
 *    counts.  (See vdev_indirect_mapping_load_obsolete_{counts,spacemap}().)
 *
 * 3. Iterate through each mapping entry, writing to the new mapping any
 *    entries that are not completely obsolete (i.e. which don't have
 *    obsolete count == mapping length).  (See
 *    spa_condense_indirect_generate_new_mapping().)
 *
 * 4. Destroy the old mapping object and switch over to the new one
 *    (spa_condense_indirect_complete_sync).
 *
 * == Restarting from failure ==
 *
 * To restart the condense when we import/open the pool, we must start
 * at the 2nd step above: reconstruct the precise counts in memory,
 * based on the space map + counts.  Then in the 3rd step, we start
 * iterating where we left off: at vimp_max_offset of the new mapping
 * object.

/*
 * This function is called when we have read all copies of the data and need

 *
 * If we pointed to any mirror vdevs, this effectively does the job of the
 * mirror.  The mirror vdev code can't do its own job because we don't know
 * the checksum of each split segment individually.
 *
 * We have to try every unique combination of copies of split segments, until
 * we find one that checksums correctly.  Duplicate segment copies are first
 * identified and latter skipped during reconstruction.  This optimization
 * reduces the search space and ensures that of the remaining combinations
 * at most one is correct.
 *
 * When the total number of combinations is small they can all be checked.
 * For example, if we have 3 segments in the split, and each points to a
 * 2-way mirror with unique copies, we will have the following pieces of data:
 *
 *       |     mirror child
 * split |     [0]        [1]
 * ======|=====================
 *   A   |  data_A_0   data_A_1
 *   B   |  data_B_0   data_B_1
 *   C   |  data_C_0   data_C_1
 *
 * We will try the following (mirror children)^(number of splits) (2^3=8)
 * combinations, which is similar to bitwise-little-endian counting in
 * binary.  In general each "digit" corresponds to a split segment, and the
 * base of each digit is is_children, which can be different for each
 * digit.
 *
 * "low bit"        "high bit"
 *        v                 v
 * data_A_0 data_B_0 data_C_0
 * data_A_1 data_B_0 data_C_0
 * data_A_0 data_B_1 data_C_0
 * data_A_1 data_B_1 data_C_0
 * data_A_0 data_B_0 data_C_1
 * data_A_1 data_B_0 data_C_1
 * data_A_0 data_B_1 data_C_1
 * data_A_1 data_B_1 data_C_1
 *
 * Note that the split segments may be on the same or different top-level
 * vdevs. In either case, we may need to try lots of combinations (see
 * zfs_reconstruct_indirect_combinations_max).  This ensures that if a mirror
 * has small silent errors on all of its children, we can still reconstruct
 * the correct data, as long as those errors are at sufficiently-separated
 * offsets (specifically, separated by the largest block size - default of
 * 128KB, but up to 16MB).
