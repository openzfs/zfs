 * # DDT: Deduplication tables
 *
 * The dedup subsystem provides block-level deduplication. When enabled, blocks
 * to be written will have the dedup (D) bit set, which causes them to be
 * tracked in a "dedup table", or DDT. If a block has been seen before (exists
 * in the DDT), instead of being written, it will instead be made to reference
 * the existing on-disk data, and a refcount bumped in the DDT instead.
 *
 * ## Dedup tables and entries
 *
 * Conceptually, a DDT is a dictionary or map. Each entry has a "key"
 * (ddt_key_t) made up a block's checksum and certian properties, and a "value"
 * (one or more ddt_phys_t) containing valid DVAs for the block's data, birth
 * time and refcount. Together these are enough to track references to a
 * specific block, to build a valid block pointer to reference that block (for
 * freeing, scrubbing, etc), and to fill a new block pointer with the missing
 * pieces to make it seem like it was written.
 *
 * There's a single DDT (ddt_t) for each checksum type, held in spa_ddt[].
 * Within each DDT, there can be multiple storage "types" (ddt_type_t, on-disk
 * object data formats, each with their own implementations) and "classes"
 * (ddt_class_t, instance of a storage type object, for entries with a specific
 * characteristic). An entry (key) will only ever exist on one of these objects
 * at any given time, but may be moved from one to another if their type or
 * class changes.
 *
 * The DDT is driven by the write IO pipeline (zio_ddt_write()). When a block
 * is to be written, before DVAs have been allocated, ddt_lookup() is called to
 * see if the block has been seen before. If its not found, the write proceeds
 * as normal, and after it succeeds, a new entry is created. If it is found, we
 * fill the BP with the DVAs from the entry, increment the refcount and cause
 * the write IO to return immediately.
 *
 * Traditionally, each ddt_phys_t slot in the entry represents a separate dedup
 * block for the same content/checksum. The slot is selected based on the
 * zp_copies parameter the block is written with, that is, the number of DVAs
 * in the block. The "ditto" slot (DDT_PHYS_DITTO) used to be used for
 * now-removed "dedupditto" feature. These are no longer written, and will be
 * freed if encountered on old pools.
 *
 * If the "fast_dedup" feature is enabled, new dedup tables will be created
 * with the "flat phys" option. In this mode, there is only one ddt_phys_t
 * slot. If a write is issued for an entry that exists, but has fewer DVAs,
 * then only as many new DVAs are allocated and written to make up the
 * shortfall. The existing entry is then extended (ddt_phys_extend()) with the
 * new DVAs.
 *
 * ## Lifetime of an entry
 *
 * A DDT can be enormous, and typically is not held in memory all at once.
 * Instead, the changes to an entry are tracked in memory, and written down to
 * disk at the end of each txg.
 *
 * A "live" in-memory entry (ddt_entry_t) is a node on the live tree
 * (ddt_tree).  At the start of a txg, ddt_tree is empty. When an entry is
 * required for IO, ddt_lookup() is called. If an entry already exists on
 * ddt_tree, it is returned. Otherwise, a new one is created, and the
 * type/class objects for the DDT are searched for that key. If its found, its
 * value is copied into the live entry. If not, an empty entry is created.
 *
 * The live entry will be modified during the txg, usually by modifying the
 * refcount, but sometimes by adding or updating DVAs. At the end of the txg
 * (during spa_sync()), type and class are recalculated for entry (see
 * ddt_sync_entry()), and the entry is written to the appropriate storage
 * object and (if necessary), removed from an old one. ddt_tree is cleared and
 * the next txg can start.
 *
 * ## Dedup quota
 *
 * A maximum size for all DDTs on the pool can be set with the
 * dedup_table_quota property. This is determined in ddt_over_quota() and
 * enforced during ddt_lookup(). If the pool is at or over its quota limit,
 * ddt_lookup() will only return entries for existing blocks, as updates are
 * still possible. New entries will not be created; instead, ddt_lookup() will
 * return NULL. In response, the DDT write stage (zio_ddt_write()) will remove
 * the D bit on the block and reissue the IO as a regular write. The block will
 * not be deduplicated.
 *
 * Note that this is based on the on-disk size of the dedup store. Reclaiming
 * this space after deleting entries relies on the ZAP "shrinking" behaviour,
 * without which, no space would be recovered and the DDT would continue to be
 * considered "over quota". See zap_shrink_enabled.
 *
 * ## Dedup table pruning
 *
 * As a complement to the dedup quota feature, ddtprune allows removal of older
 * non-duplicate entries to make room for newer duplicate entries. The amount
 * to prune can be based on a target percentage of the unique entries or based
 * on the age (i.e., prune unique entry older than N days).
 *
 * ## Dedup log
 *
 * Historically, all entries modified on a txg were written back to dedup
 * storage objects at the end of every txg. This could cause significant
 * overheads, as each entry only takes up a tiny portion of a ZAP leaf node,
 * and so required reading the whole node, updating the entry, and writing it
 * back. On busy pools, this could add serious IO and memory overheads.
 *
 * To address this, the dedup log was added. If the "fast_dedup" feature is
 * enabled, at the end of each txg, modified entries will be copied to an
 * in-memory "log" object (ddt_log_t), and appended to an on-disk log. If the
 * same block is requested again, the in-memory object will be checked first,
 * and if its there, the entry inflated back onto the live tree without going
 * to storage. The on-disk log is only read at pool import time, to reload the
 * in-memory log.
 *
 * Each txg, some amount of the in-memory log will be flushed out to a DDT
 * storage object (ie ZAP) as normal. OpenZFS will try hard to flush enough to
 * keep up with the rate of change on dedup entries, but not so much that it
 * would impact overall throughput, and not using too much memory. See the
 * zfs_dedup_log_* tuneables in zfs(4) for more details.
 *
 * ## Repair IO
 *
 * If a read on a dedup block fails, but there are other copies of the block in
 * the other ddt_phys_t slots, reads will be issued for those instead
 * (zio_ddt_read_start()). If one of those succeeds, the read is returned to
 * the caller, and a copy is stashed on the entry's dde_repair_abd.
 *
 * During the end-of-txg sync, any entries with a dde_repair_abd get a
 * "rewrite" write issued for the original block pointer, with the data read
 * from the alternate block. If the block is actually damaged, this will invoke
 * the pool's "self-healing" mechanism, and repair the block.
 *
 * If the "fast_dedup" feature is enabled, the "flat phys" option will be in
 * use, so there is only ever one ddt_phys_t slot. The repair process will
 * still happen in this case, though it is unlikely to succeed as there will
 * usually be no other equivalent blocks to fall back on (though there might
 * be, if this was an early version of a dedup'd block that has since been
 * extended).
 *
 * Note that this repair mechanism is in addition to and separate from the
 * regular OpenZFS scrub and self-healing mechanisms.
 *
 * ## Scanning (scrub/resilver)
 *
 * If dedup is active, the scrub machinery will walk the dedup table first, and
 * scrub all blocks with refcnt > 1 first. After that it will move on to the
 * regular top-down scrub, and exclude the refcnt > 1 blocks when it sees them.
 * In this way, heavily deduplicated blocks are only scrubbed once. See the
 * commentary on dsl_scan_ddt() for more details.
 *
 * Walking the DDT is done via ddt_walk(). The current position is stored in a
 * ddt_bookmark_t, which represents a stable position in the storage object.
 * This bookmark is stored by the scan machinery, and must reference the same
 * position on the object even if the object changes, the pool is exported, or
 * OpenZFS is upgraded.
 *
 * If the "fast_dedup" feature is enabled and the table has a log, the scan
 * cannot begin until entries on the log are flushed, as the on-disk log has no
 * concept of a "stable position". Instead, the log flushing process will enter
 * a more aggressive mode, to flush out as much as is necesary as soon as
 * possible, in order to begin the scan as soon as possible.
 *
 * ## Interaction with block cloning
 *
 * If block cloning and dedup are both enabled on a pool, BRT will look for the
 * dedup bit on an incoming block pointer. If set, it will call into the DDT
 * (ddt_addref()) to add a reference to the block, instead of adding a
 * reference to the BRT. See brt_pending_apply().
