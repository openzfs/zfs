/*
 * Embedded-data Block Pointers
 *
 * Normally, block pointers point (via their DVAs) to a block which holds data.
 * If the data that we need to store is very small, this is an inefficient
 * use of space, because a block must be at minimum 1 sector (typically 512
 * bytes or 4KB).  Additionally, reading these small blocks tends to generate
 * more random reads.
 *
 * Embedded-data Block Pointers allow small pieces of data (the "payload",
 * up to 112 bytes) to be stored in the block pointer itself, instead of
 * being pointed to.  The "Pointer" part of this name is a bit of a
 * misnomer, as nothing is pointed to.
 *
 * BP_EMBEDDED_TYPE_DATA block pointers allow highly-compressible data to
 * be embedded in the block pointer.  The logic for this is handled in
 * the SPA, by the zio pipeline.  Therefore most code outside the zio
 * pipeline doesn't need special-cases to handle these block pointers.
 *
 * See spa.h for details on the exact layout of embedded block pointers.
