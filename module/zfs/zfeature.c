/*
 * ZFS Feature Flags
 * -----------------
 *
 * ZFS feature flags are used to provide fine-grained versioning to the ZFS
 * on-disk format. Once enabled on a pool feature flags replace the old
 * spa_version() number.
 *
 * Each new on-disk format change will be given a uniquely identifying string
 * guid rather than a version number. This avoids the problem of different
 * organizations creating new on-disk formats with the same version number. To
 * keep feature guids unique they should consist of the reverse dns name of the
 * organization which implemented the feature and a short name for the feature,
 * separated by a colon (e.g. com.delphix:async_destroy).
 *
 * Reference Counts
 * ----------------
 *
 * Within each pool features can be in one of three states: disabled, enabled,
 * or active. These states are differentiated by a reference count stored on
 * disk for each feature:
 *
 *   1) If there is no reference count stored on disk the feature is disabled.
 *   2) If the reference count is 0 a system administrator has enabled the
 *      feature, but the feature has not been used yet, so no on-disk
 *      format changes have been made.
 *   3) If the reference count is greater than 0 the feature is active.
 *      The format changes required by the feature are currently on disk.
 *      Note that if the feature's format changes are reversed the feature
 *      may choose to set its reference count back to 0.
 *
 * Feature flags makes no differentiation between non-zero reference counts
 * for an active feature (e.g. a reference count of 1 means the same thing as a
 * reference count of 27834721), but feature implementations may choose to use
 * the reference count to store meaningful information. For example, a new RAID
 * implementation might set the reference count to the number of vdevs using
 * it. If all those disks are removed from the pool the feature goes back to
 * having a reference count of 0.
 *
 * It is the responsibility of the individual features to maintain a non-zero
 * reference count as long as the feature's format changes are present on disk.
 *
 * Dependencies
 * ------------
 *
 * Each feature may depend on other features. The only effect of this
 * relationship is that when a feature is enabled all of its dependencies are
 * automatically enabled as well. Any future work to support disabling of
 * features would need to ensure that features cannot be disabled if other
 * enabled features depend on them.
 *
 * On-disk Format
 * --------------
 *
 * When feature flags are enabled spa_version() is set to SPA_VERSION_FEATURES
 * (5000). In order for this to work the pool is automatically upgraded to
 * SPA_VERSION_BEFORE_FEATURES (28) first, so all pre-feature flags on disk
 * format changes will be in use.
 *
 * Information about features is stored in 3 ZAP objects in the pool's MOS.
 * These objects are linked to by the following names in the pool directory
 * object:
 *
 * 1) features_for_read: feature guid -> reference count
 *    Features needed to open the pool for reading.
 * 2) features_for_write: feature guid -> reference count
 *    Features needed to open the pool for writing.
 * 3) feature_descriptions: feature guid -> descriptive string
 *    A human readable string.
 *
 * All enabled features appear in either features_for_read or
 * features_for_write, but not both.
 *
 * To open a pool in read-only mode only the features listed in
 * features_for_read need to be supported.
 *
 * To open the pool in read-write mode features in both features_for_read and
 * features_for_write need to be supported.
 *
 * Some features may be required to read the ZAP objects containing feature
 * information. To allow software to check for compatibility with these features
 * before the pool is opened their names must be stored in the label in a
 * new "features_for_read" entry (note that features that are only required
 * to write to a pool never need to be stored in the label since the
 * features_for_write ZAP object can be read before the pool is written to).
 * To save space in the label features must be explicitly marked as needing to
 * be written to the label. Also, reference counts are not stored in the label,
 * instead any feature whose reference count drops to 0 is removed from the
 * label.
 *
 * Adding New Features
 * -------------------
 *
 * Features must be registered in zpool_feature_init() function in
 * zfeature_common.c using the zfeature_register() function. This function
 * has arguments to specify if the feature should be stored in the
 * features_for_read or features_for_write ZAP object and if it needs to be
 * written to the label when active.
 *
 * Once a feature is registered it will appear as a "feature@<feature name>"
 * property which can be set by an administrator. Feature implementors should
 * use the spa_feature_is_enabled() and spa_feature_is_active() functions to
 * query the state of a feature and the spa_feature_incr() and
 * spa_feature_decr() functions to change an enabled feature's reference count.
 * Reference counts may only be updated in the syncing context.
 *
 * Features may not perform enable-time initialization. Instead, any such
 * initialization should occur when the feature is first used. This design
 * enforces that on-disk changes be made only when features are used. Code
 * should only check if a feature is enabled using spa_feature_is_enabled(),
 * not by relying on any feature specific metadata existing. If a feature is
 * enabled, but the feature's metadata is not on disk yet then it should be
 * created as needed.
 *
 * As an example, consider the com.delphix:async_destroy feature. This feature
 * relies on the existence of a bptree in the MOS that store blocks for
 * asynchronous freeing. This bptree is not created when async_destroy is
 * enabled. Instead, when a dataset is destroyed spa_feature_is_enabled() is
 * called to check if async_destroy is enabled. If it is and the bptree object
 * does not exist yet, the bptree object is created as part of the dataset
 * destroy and async_destroy's reference count is incremented to indicate it
 * has made an on-disk format change. Later, after the destroyed dataset's
 * blocks have all been asynchronously freed there is no longer any use for the
 * bptree object, so it is destroyed and async_destroy's reference count is
 * decremented back to 0 to indicate that it has undone its on-disk format
 * changes.
