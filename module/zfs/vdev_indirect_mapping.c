 *        the offset and the mapping entry and 1 will be returned.

 *        entry's "range" can be considered to be inclusive at its
 *        start, but exclusive at its end: e.g. [src, src + size).
 *
 *     3. The last case to consider is if the offset actually falls
 *        within the mapping entry's range. If this is the case, the
 *        offset is considered to be "equal to" the mapping entry and
 *        0 will be returned.
 *
 *        NOTE: If the offset is equal to the entry's source offset,
 *        this case applies and 0 will be returned. If the offset is
 *        equal to the entry's source plus its size, this case does
 *        *not* apply (see "NOTE" above for scenario 2), and 1 will be
