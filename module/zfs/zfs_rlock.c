/*
 * This file contains the code to implement file range locking in
 * ZFS, although there isn't much specific to ZFS (all that comes to mind is
 * support for growing the blocksize).
 *
 * Interface
 * ---------
 * Defined in zfs_rlock.h but essentially:
 *	rl = zfs_range_lock(zp, off, len, lock_type);
 *	zfs_range_unlock(rl);
 *	zfs_range_reduce(rl, off, len);
 *
 * AVL tree
 * --------
 * An AVL tree is used to maintain the state of the existing ranges
 * that are locked for exclusive (writer) or shared (reader) use.
 * The starting range offset is used for searching and sorting the tree.
 *
 * Common case
 * -----------
 * The (hopefully) usual case is of no overlaps or contention for
 * locks. On entry to zfs_lock_range() a rl_t is allocated; the tree
 * searched that finds no overlap, and *this* rl_t is placed in the tree.
 *
 * Overlaps/Reference counting/Proxy locks
 * ---------------------------------------
 * The avl code only allows one node at a particular offset. Also it's very
 * inefficient to search through all previous entries looking for overlaps
 * (because the very 1st in the ordered list might be at offset 0 but
 * cover the whole file).
 * So this implementation uses reference counts and proxy range locks.
 * Firstly, only reader locks use reference counts and proxy locks,
 * because writer locks are exclusive.
 * When a reader lock overlaps with another then a proxy lock is created
 * for that range and replaces the original lock. If the overlap
 * is exact then the reference count of the proxy is simply incremented.
 * Otherwise, the proxy lock is split into smaller lock ranges and
 * new proxy locks created for non overlapping ranges.
 * The reference counts are adjusted accordingly.
 * Meanwhile, the orginal lock is kept around (this is the callers handle)
 * and its offset and length are used when releasing the lock.
 *
 * Thread coordination
 * -------------------
 * In order to make wakeups efficient and to ensure multiple continuous
 * readers on a range don't starve a writer for the same range lock,
 * two condition variables are allocated in each rl_t.
 * If a writer (or reader) can't get a range it initialises the writer
 * (or reader) cv; sets a flag saying there's a writer (or reader) waiting;
 * and waits on that cv. When a thread unlocks that range it wakes up all
 * writers then all readers before destroying the lock.
 *
 * Append mode writes
 * ------------------
 * Append mode writes need to lock a range at the end of a file.
 * The offset of the end of the file is determined under the
 * range locking mutex, and the lock type converted from RL_APPEND to
 * RL_WRITER and the range locked.
 *
 * Grow block handling
 * -------------------
 * ZFS supports multiple block sizes currently upto 128K. The smallest
 * block size is used for the file which is grown as needed. During this
 * growth all other writers and readers must be excluded.
 * So if the block size needs to be grown then the whole file is
 * exclusively locked, then later the caller will reduce the lock
 * range to just the range to be written using zfs_reduce_range.
