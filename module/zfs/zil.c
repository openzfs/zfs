/*
 * The ZFS Intent Log (ZIL) saves "transaction records" (itxs) of system
 * calls that change the file system. Each itx has enough information to
 * be able to replay them after a system crash, power loss, or
 * equivalent failure mode. These are stored in memory until either:
 *
 *   1. they are committed to the pool by the DMU transaction group
 *      (txg), at which point they can be discarded; or
 *   2. they are committed to the on-disk ZIL for the dataset being
 *      modified (e.g. due to an fsync, O_DSYNC, or other synchronous
 *      requirement).
 *
 * In the event of a crash or power loss, the itxs contained by each
 * dataset's on-disk ZIL will be replayed when that dataset is first
 * instantiated (e.g. if the dataset is a normal fileystem, when it is
 * first mounted).
 *
 * As hinted at above, there is one ZIL per dataset (both the in-memory
 * representation, and the on-disk representation). The on-disk format
 * consists of 3 parts:
 *
 * 	- a single, per-dataset, ZIL header; which points to a chain of
 * 	- zero or more ZIL blocks; each of which contains
 * 	- zero or more ZIL records
 *
 * A ZIL record holds the information necessary to replay a single
 * system call transaction. A ZIL block can hold many ZIL records, and
 * the blocks are chained together, similarly to a singly linked list.
 *
 * Each ZIL block contains a block pointer (blkptr_t) to the next ZIL
 * block in the chain, and the ZIL header points to the first block in
 * the chain.
 *
 * Note, there is not a fixed place in the pool to hold these ZIL
 * blocks; they are dynamically allocated and freed as needed from the
 * blocks available on the pool, though they can be preferentially
 * allocated from a dedicated "log" vdev.
 */

/*
 * This controls the amount of time that a ZIL block (lwb) will remain
 * "open" when it isn't "full", and it has a thread waiting for it to be
 * committed to stable storage. Please refer to the zil_commit_waiter()
 * function (and the comments within it) for more details.

		 *
		 * 2. If there isn't sufficient ZIL activity occurring on
		 * the system, such that this lwb's zio isn't issued via
		 * zil_lwb_commit(), zil_commit_waiter() will issue the
		 * lwb's zio. If this occurs, the lwb is not guaranteed
		 * to be "full" by the time its zio is issued, and means
		 * the size of the lwb was "too large" given the amount
		 * of ZIL activity occurring on the system at that time.
		 *
		 * We do this for a couple of reasons:
		 *
		 * 1. To try and reduce the number of IOPs needed to
		 * write the same number of itxs. If an lwb has space
		 * available in its buffer for more itxs, and more itxs
		 * will be committed relatively soon (relative to the
		 * latency of performing a write), then it's beneficial
		 * to wait for these "next" itxs. This way, more itxs
		 * can be committed to stable storage with fewer writes.
		 *
		 * 2. To try and use the largest lwb block size that the
		 * incoming rate of itxs can support. Again, this is to
		 * try and pack as many itxs into as few lwbs as
		 * possible, without significantly impacting the latency
		 * of each individual itx.

/*
 * Commit ZFS Intent Log transactions (itxs) to stable storage.
 *
 * When writing ZIL transactions to the on-disk representation of the
 * ZIL, the itxs are committed to a Log Write Block (lwb). Multiple
 * itxs can be committed to a single lwb. Once a lwb is written and
 * committed to stable storage (i.e. the lwb is written, and vdevs have
 * been flushed), each itx that was committed to that lwb is also
 * considered to be committed to stable storage.
 *
 * When an itx is committed to an lwb, the log record (lr_t) contained
 * by the itx is copied into the lwb's zio buffer, and once this buffer
 * is written to disk, it becomes an on-disk ZIL block.
 *
 * As itxs are generated, they're inserted into the ZIL's queue of
 * uncommitted itxs. The semantics of zil_commit() are such that it will
 * block until all itxs that were in the queue when it was called, are
 * committed to stable storage.
 *
 * If "foid" is zero, this means all "synchronous" and "asynchronous"
 * itxs, for all objects in the dataset, will be committed to stable
 * storage prior to zil_commit() returning. If "foid" is non-zero, all
 * "synchronous" itxs for all objects, but only "asynchronous" itxs
 * that correspond to the foid passed in, will be committed to stable
 * storage prior to zil_commit() returning.
 *
 * Generally speaking, when zil_commit() is called, the consumer doesn't
 * actually care about _all_ of the uncommitted itxs. Instead, they're
 * simply trying to waiting for a specific itx to be committed to disk,
 * but the interface(s) for interacting with the ZIL don't allow such
 * fine-grained communication. A better interface would allow a consumer
 * to create and assign an itx, and then pass a reference to this itx to
 * zil_commit(); such that zil_commit() would return as soon as that
 * specific itx was committed to disk (instead of waiting for _all_
 * itxs to be committed).
 *
 * When a thread calls zil_commit() a special "commit itx" will be
 * generated, along with a corresponding "waiter" for this commit itx.
 * zil_commit() will wait on this waiter's CV, such that when the waiter
 * is marked done, and signaled, zil_commit() will return.
 *
 * This commit itx is inserted into the queue of uncommitted itxs. This
 * provides an easy mechanism for determining which itxs were in the
 * queue prior to zil_commit() having been called, and which itxs were
 * added after zil_commit() was called.
 *
 * The commit it is special; it doesn't have any on-disk representation.
 * When a commit itx is "committed" to an lwb, the waiter associated
 * with it is linked onto the lwb's list of waiters. Then, when that lwb
 * completes, each waiter on the lwb's list is marked done and signaled
 * -- allowing the thread waiting on the waiter to return from zil_commit().
 *
 * It's important to point out a few critical factors that allow us
 * to make use of the commit itxs, commit waiters, per-lwb lists of
 * commit waiters, and zio completion callbacks like we're doing:
 *
 *   1. The list of waiters for each lwb is traversed, and each commit
 *      waiter is marked "done" and signaled, in the zio completion
 *      callback of the lwb's zio[*].
 *
 *      * Actually, the waiters are signaled in the zio completion
 *        callback of the root zio for the DKIOCFLUSHWRITECACHE commands
 *        that are sent to the vdevs upon completion of the lwb zio.
 *
 *   2. When the itxs are inserted into the ZIL's queue of uncommitted
 *      itxs, the order in which they are inserted is preserved[*]; as
 *      itxs are added to the queue, they are added to the tail of
 *      in-memory linked lists.
 *
 *      When committing the itxs to lwbs (to be written to disk), they
 *      are committed in the same order in which the itxs were added to
 *      the uncommitted queue's linked list(s); i.e. the linked list of
 *      itxs to commit is traversed from head to tail, and each itx is
 *      committed to an lwb in that order.
 *
 *      * To clarify:
 *
 *        - the order of "sync" itxs is preserved w.r.t. other
 *          "sync" itxs, regardless of the corresponding objects.
 *        - the order of "async" itxs is preserved w.r.t. other
 *          "async" itxs corresponding to the same object.
 *        - the order of "async" itxs is *not* preserved w.r.t. other
 *          "async" itxs corresponding to different objects.
 *        - the order of "sync" itxs w.r.t. "async" itxs (or vice
 *          versa) is *not* preserved, even for itxs that correspond
 *          to the same object.
 *
 *      For more details, see: zil_itx_assign(), zil_async_to_sync(),
 *      zil_get_commit_list(), and zil_process_commit_list().
 *
 *   3. The lwbs represent a linked list of blocks on disk. Thus, any
 *      lwb cannot be considered committed to stable storage, until its
 *      "previous" lwb is also committed to stable storage. This fact,
 *      coupled with the fact described above, means that itxs are
 *      committed in (roughly) the order in which they were generated.
 *      This is essential because itxs are dependent on prior itxs.
 *      Thus, we *must not* deem an itx as being committed to stable
 *      storage, until *all* prior itxs have also been committed to
 *      stable storage.
 *
 *      To enforce this ordering of lwb zio's, while still leveraging as
 *      much of the underlying storage performance as possible, we rely
 *      on two fundamental concepts:
 *
 *          1. The creation and issuance of lwb zio's is protected by
 *             the zilog's "zl_issuer_lock", which ensures only a single
 *             thread is creating and/or issuing lwb's at a time
 *          2. The "previous" lwb is a child of the "current" lwb
 *             (leveraging the zio parent-child dependency graph)
 *
 *      By relying on this parent-child zio relationship, we can have
 *      many lwb zio's concurrently issued to the underlying storage,
 *      but the order in which they complete will be the same order in
 *      which they were created.
