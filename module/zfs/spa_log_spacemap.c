/*
 * Log Space Maps
 *
 * Log space maps are an optimization in ZFS metadata allocations for pools
 * whose workloads are primarily random-writes. Random-write workloads are also
 * typically random-free, meaning that they are freeing from locations scattered
 * throughout the pool. This means that each TXG we will have to append some
 * FREE records to almost every metaslab. With log space maps, we hold their
 * changes in memory and log them altogether in one pool-wide space map on-disk
 * for persistence. As more blocks are accumulated in the log space maps and
 * more unflushed changes are accounted in memory, we flush a selected group
 * of metaslabs every TXG to relieve memory pressure and potential overheads
 * when loading the pool. Flushing a metaslab to disk relieves memory as we
 * flush any unflushed changes from memory to disk (i.e. the metaslab's space
 * map) and saves import time by making old log space maps obsolete and
 * eventually destroying them. [A log space map is said to be obsolete when all
 * its entries have made it to their corresponding metaslab space maps].
 *
 * == On disk data structures used ==
 *
 * - The pool has a new feature flag and a new entry in the MOS. The feature
 *   is activated when we create the first log space map and remains active
 *   for the lifetime of the pool. The new entry in the MOS Directory [refer
 *   to DMU_POOL_LOG_SPACEMAP_ZAP] is populated with a ZAP whose key-value
 *   pairs are of the form <key: txg, value: log space map object for that txg>.
 *   This entry is our on-disk reference of the log space maps that exist in
 *   the pool for each TXG and it is used during import to load all the
 *   metaslab unflushed changes in memory. To see how this structure is first
 *   created and later populated refer to spa_generate_syncing_log_sm(). To see
 *   how it is used during import time refer to spa_ld_log_sm_metadata().
 *
 * - Each vdev has a new entry in its vdev_top_zap (see field
 *   VDEV_TOP_ZAP_MS_UNFLUSHED_PHYS_TXGS) which holds the msp_unflushed_txg of
 *   each metaslab in this vdev. This field is the on-disk counterpart of the
 *   in-memory field ms_unflushed_txg which tells us from which TXG and onwards
 *   the metaslab haven't had its changes flushed. During import, we use this
 *   to ignore any entries in the space map log that are for this metaslab but
 *   from a TXG before msp_unflushed_txg. At that point, we also populate its
 *   in-memory counterpart and from there both fields are updated every time
 *   we flush that metaslab.
 *
 * - A space map is created every TXG and, during that TXG, it is used to log
 *   all incoming changes (the log space map). When created, the log space map
 *   is referenced in memory by spa_syncing_log_sm and its object ID is inserted
 *   to the space map ZAP mentioned above. The log space map is closed at the
 *   end of the TXG and will be destroyed when it becomes fully obsolete. We
 *   know when a log space map has become obsolete by looking at the oldest
 *   (and smallest) ms_unflushed_txg in the pool. If the value of that is bigger
 *   than the log space map's TXG, then it means that there is no metaslab who
 *   doesn't have the changes from that log and we can therefore destroy it.
 *   [see spa_cleanup_old_sm_logs()].
 *
 * == Important in-memory structures ==
 *
 * - The per-spa field spa_metaslabs_by_flushed sorts all the metaslabs in
 *   the pool by their ms_unflushed_txg field. It is primarily used for three
 *   reasons. First of all, it is used during flushing where we try to flush
 *   metaslabs in-order from the oldest-flushed to the most recently flushed
 *   every TXG. Secondly, it helps us to lookup the ms_unflushed_txg of the
 *   oldest flushed metaslab to distinguish which log space maps have become
 *   obsolete and which ones are still relevant. Finally it tells us which
 *   metaslabs have unflushed changes in a pool where this feature was just
 *   enabled, as we don't immediately add all of the pool's metaslabs but we
 *   add them over time as they go through metaslab_sync(). The reason that
 *   we do that is to ease these pools into the behavior of the flushing
 *   algorithm (described later on).
 *
 * - The per-spa field spa_sm_logs_by_txg can be thought as the in-memory
 *   counterpart of the space map ZAP mentioned above. It's an AVL tree whose
 *   nodes represent the log space maps in the pool. This in-memory
 *   representation of log space maps in the pool sorts the log space maps by
 *   the TXG that they were created (which is also the TXG of their unflushed
 *   changes). It also contains the following extra information for each
 *   space map:
 *   [1] The number of metaslabs that were last flushed on that TXG. This is
 *       important because if that counter is zero and this is the oldest
 *       log then it means that it is also obsolete.
 *   [2] The number of blocks of that space map. This field is used by the
 *       block heuristic of our flushing algorithm (described later on).
 *       It represents how many blocks of metadata changes ZFS had to write
 *       to disk for that TXG.
 *
 * - The per-spa field spa_log_summary is a list of entries that summarizes
 *   the metaslab and block counts of all the nodes of the spa_sm_logs_by_txg
 *   AVL tree mentioned above. The reason this exists is that our flushing
 *   algorithm (described later) tries to estimate how many metaslabs to flush
 *   in each TXG by iterating over all the log space maps and looking at their
 *   block counts. Summarizing that information means that don't have to
 *   iterate through each space map, minimizing the runtime overhead of the
 *   flushing algorithm which would be induced in syncing context. In terms of
 *   implementation the log summary is used as a queue:
 *   * we modify or pop entries from its head when we flush metaslabs
 *   * we modify or append entries to its tail when we sync changes.
 *
 * - Each metaslab has two new range trees that hold its unflushed changes,
 *   ms_unflushed_allocs and ms_unflushed_frees. These are always disjoint.
 *
 * == Flushing algorithm ==
 *
 * The decision of how many metaslabs to flush on a give TXG is guided by
 * two heuristics:
 *
 * [1] The memory heuristic -
 * We keep track of the memory used by the unflushed trees from all the
 * metaslabs [see sus_memused of spa_unflushed_stats] and we ensure that it
 * stays below a certain threshold which is determined by an arbitrary hard
 * limit and an arbitrary percentage of the system's memory [see
 * spa_log_exceeds_memlimit()]. When we see that the memory usage of the
 * unflushed changes are passing that threshold, we flush metaslabs, which
 * empties their unflushed range trees, reducing the memory used.
 *
 * [2] The block heuristic -
 * We try to keep the total number of blocks in the log space maps in check
 * so the log doesn't grow indefinitely and we don't induce a lot of overhead
 * when loading the pool. At the same time we don't want to flush a lot of
 * metaslabs too often as this would defeat the purpose of the log space map.
 * As a result we set a limit in the amount of blocks that we think it's
 * acceptable for the log space maps to have and try not to cross it.
 * [see sus_blocklimit from spa_unflushed_stats].
 *
 * In order to stay below the block limit every TXG we have to estimate how
 * many metaslabs we need to flush based on the current rate of incoming blocks
 * and our history of log space map blocks. The main idea here is to answer
 * the question of how many metaslabs do we need to flush in order to get rid
 * at least an X amount of log space map blocks. We can answer this question
 * by iterating backwards from the oldest log space map to the newest one
 * and looking at their metaslab and block counts. At this point the log summary
 * mentioned above comes handy as it reduces the amount of things that we have
 * to iterate (even though it may reduce the preciseness of our estimates due
 * to its aggregation of data). So with that in mind, we project the incoming
 * rate of the current TXG into the future and attempt to approximate how many
 * metaslabs would we need to flush from now in order to avoid exceeding our
 * block limit in different points in the future (granted that we would keep
 * flushing the same number of metaslabs for every TXG). Then we take the
 * maximum number from all these estimates to be on the safe side. For the
 * exact implementation details of algorithm refer to
 * spa_estimate_metaslabs_to_flush.

 * The following tunable determines the number of blocks that can be used for
 * the log space maps. It is expressed as a percentage of the total number of
 * metaslabs in the pool (i.e. the default of 400 means that the number of log
 * blocks is capped at 4 times the number of metaslabs).
 *
 * This value exists to tune our flushing algorithm, with higher values
 * flushing metaslabs less often (doing less I/Os) per TXG versus lower values
 * flushing metaslabs more aggressively with the upside of saving overheads
 * when loading the pool. Another factor in this tradeoff is that flushing
 * less often can potentially lead to better utilization of the metaslab space
 * map's block size as we accumulate more changes per flush.
 *
 * Given that this tunable indirectly controls the flush rate (metaslabs
 * flushed per txg) and that's why making it a percentage in terms of the
 * number of metaslabs in the pool makes sense here.
 *
 * As a rule of thumb we default this tunable to 400% based on the following:
 *
 * 1] Assuming a constant flush rate and a constant incoming rate of log blocks
 *    it is reasonable to expect that the amount of obsolete entries changes
 *    linearly from txg to txg (e.g. the oldest log should have the most
 *    obsolete entries, and the most recent one the least). With this we could
 *    say that, at any given time, about half of the entries in the whole space
 *    map log are obsolete. Thus for every two entries for a metaslab in the
 *    log space map, only one of them is valid and actually makes it to the
 *    metaslab's space map.
 *    [factor of 2]
 * 2] Each entry in the log space map is guaranteed to be two words while
 *    entries in metaslab space maps are generally single-word.
 *    [an extra factor of 2 - 400% overall]
 * 3] Even if [1] and [2] are slightly less than 2 each, we haven't taken into
 *    account any consolidation of segments from the log space map to the
 *    unflushed range trees nor their history (e.g. a segment being allocated,
 *    then freed, then allocated again means 3 log space map entries but 0
 *    metaslab space map entries). Depending on the workload, we've seen ~1.8
 *    non-obsolete log space map entries per metaslab entry, for a total of
 *    ~600%. Since most of these estimates though are workload dependent, we
 *    default on 400% to be conservative.
 *
 *    Thus we could say that even in the worst
 *    case of [1] and [2], the factor should end up being 4.
 *
 * That said, regardless of the number of metaslabs in the pool we need to
 * provide upper and lower bounds for the log block limit.

 * Update the log summary information to reflect the fact that we destroyed

 *
 * This function is called after a metaslab is flushed and typically that
 * metaslab is the oldest flushed, which means that this function will
 * typically decrement the block count of the first entry of the summary and
 * potentially free it if the block count gets to zero (its metaslab count
 * should be zero too at that point).
 *
 * There are certain scenarios though that don't work exactly like that so we
 * need to account for them:
 *
 * Scenario [1]: It is possible that after we flushed the oldest flushed
 * metaslab and we destroyed the oldest log space map, more recent logs had 0
 * metaslabs pointing to them so we got rid of them too. This can happen due
 * to metaslabs being destroyed through device removal, or because the oldest
 * flushed metaslab was loading but we kept flushing more recently flushed
 * metaslabs due to the memory pressure of unflushed changes. Because of that,
 * we always iterate from the beginning of the summary and if blocks_gone is
 * bigger than the block_count of the current entry we free that entry (we
 * expect its metaslab count to be zero), we decrement blocks_gone and on to
 * the next entry repeating this procedure until blocks_gone gets decremented
 * to 0. Doing this also works for the typical case mentioned above.
 *
 * Scenario [2]: The oldest flushed metaslab isn't necessarily accounted by
 * the first (and oldest) entry in the summary. If the first few entries of
 * the summary were only accounting metaslabs from a device that was just
 * removed, then the current oldest flushed metaslab could be accounted by an
 * entry somewhere in the middle of the summary. Moreover flushing that
 * metaslab will destroy all the log space maps older than its ms_unflushed_txg
 * because they became obsolete after the removal. Thus, iterating as we did
 * for scenario [1] works out for this case too.
 *
 * Scenario [3]: At times we decide to flush all the metaslabs in the pool
 * in one TXG (either because we are exporting the pool or because our flushing
 * heuristics decided to do so). When that happens all the log space maps get
 * destroyed except the one created for the current TXG which doesn't have
 * any log blocks yet. As log space maps get destroyed with every metaslab that
 * we flush, entries in the summary are also destroyed. This brings a weird
 * corner-case when we flush the last metaslab and the log space map of the
 * current TXG is in the same summary entry with other log space maps that
 * are older. When that happens we are eventually left with this one last
 * summary entry whose blocks are gone (blocks_gone equals the entry's block
 * count) but its metaslab count is non-zero (because it accounts all the
 * metaslabs in the pool as they all got flushed). Under this scenario we can't
 * free this last summary entry as it's referencing all the metaslabs in the
 * pool and its block count will get incremented at the end of this sync (when
 * we close the syncing log space map). Thus we just decrement its current
 * block count and leave it alone. In the case that the pool gets exported,
 * its metaslab count will be decremented over time as we call metaslab_fini()
 * for all the metaslabs in the pool and the entry will be freed at
