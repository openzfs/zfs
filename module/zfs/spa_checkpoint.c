/*
 * Storage Pool Checkpoint
 *
 * A storage pool checkpoint can be thought of as a pool-wide snapshot or
 * a stable version of extreme rewind that guarantees no blocks from the
 * checkpointed state will have been overwritten. It remembers the entire
 * state of the storage pool (e.g. snapshots, dataset names, etc..) from the
 * point that it was taken and the user can rewind back to that point even if
 * they applied destructive operations on their datasets or even enabled new
 * zpool on-disk features. If a pool has a checkpoint that is no longer
 * needed, the user can discard it.
 *
 * == On disk data structures used ==
 *
 * - The pool has a new feature flag and a new entry in the MOS. The feature
 *   flag is set to active when we create the checkpoint and remains active
 *   until the checkpoint is fully discarded. The entry in the MOS config
 *   (DMU_POOL_ZPOOL_CHECKPOINT) is populated with the uberblock that
 *   references the state of the pool when we take the checkpoint. The entry
 *   remains populated until we start discarding the checkpoint or we rewind
 *   back to it.
 *
 * - Each vdev contains a vdev-wide space map while the pool has a checkpoint,
 *   which persists until the checkpoint is fully discarded. The space map
 *   contains entries that have been freed in the current state of the pool
 *   but we want to keep around in case we decide to rewind to the checkpoint.
 *   [see vdev_checkpoint_sm]
 *
 * - Each metaslab's ms_sm space map behaves the same as without the
 *   checkpoint, with the only exception being the scenario when we free
 *   blocks that belong to the checkpoint. In this case, these blocks remain
 *   ALLOCATED in the metaslab's space map and they are added as FREE in the
 *   vdev's checkpoint space map.
 *
 * - Each uberblock has a field (ub_checkpoint_txg) which holds the txg that
 *   the uberblock was checkpointed. For normal uberblocks this field is 0.
 *
 * == Overview of operations ==
 *
 * - To create a checkpoint, we first wait for the current TXG to be synced,
 *   so we can use the most recently synced uberblock (spa_ubsync) as the
 *   checkpointed uberblock. Then we use an early synctask to place that
 *   uberblock in MOS config, increment the feature flag for the checkpoint
 *   (marking it active), and setting spa_checkpoint_txg (see its use below)
 *   to the TXG of the checkpointed uberblock. We use an early synctask for
 *   the aforementioned operations to ensure that no blocks were dirtied
 *   between the current TXG and the TXG of the checkpointed uberblock
 *   (e.g the previous txg).
 *
 * - When a checkpoint exists, we need to ensure that the blocks that
 *   belong to the checkpoint are freed but never reused. This means that
 *   these blocks should never end up in the ms_allocatable or the ms_freeing
 *   trees of a metaslab. Therefore, whenever there is a checkpoint the new
 *   ms_checkpointing tree is used in addition to the aforementioned ones.
 *
 *   Whenever a block is freed and we find out that it is referenced by the
 *   checkpoint (we find out by comparing its birth to spa_checkpoint_txg),
 *   we place it in the ms_checkpointing tree instead of the ms_freeingtree.
 *   This way, we divide the blocks that are being freed into checkpointed
 *   and not-checkpointed blocks.
 *
 *   In order to persist these frees, we write the extents from the
 *   ms_freeingtree to the ms_sm as usual, and the extents from the
 *   ms_checkpointing tree to the vdev_checkpoint_sm. This way, these
 *   checkpointed extents will remain allocated in the metaslab's ms_sm space
 *   map, and therefore won't be reused [see metaslab_sync()]. In addition,
 *   when we discard the checkpoint, we can find the entries that have
 *   actually been freed in vdev_checkpoint_sm.
 *   [see spa_checkpoint_discard_thread_sync()]
 *
 * - To discard the checkpoint we use an early synctask to delete the
 *   checkpointed uberblock from the MOS config, set spa_checkpoint_txg to 0,
 *   and wakeup the discarding zthr thread (an open-context async thread).
 *   We use an early synctask to ensure that the operation happens before any
 *   new data end up in the checkpoint's data structures.
 *
 *   Once the synctask is done and the discarding zthr is awake, we discard
 *   the checkpointed data over multiple TXGs by having the zthr prefetching
 *   entries from vdev_checkpoint_sm and then starting a synctask that places
 *   them as free blocks into their respective ms_allocatable and ms_sm
 *   structures.
 *   [see spa_checkpoint_discard_thread()]
 *
 *   When there are no entries left in the vdev_checkpoint_sm of all
 *   top-level vdevs, a final synctask runs that decrements the feature flag.
 *
 * - To rewind to the checkpoint, we first use the current uberblock and
 *   open the MOS so we can access the checkpointed uberblock from the MOS
 *   config. After we retrieve the checkpointed uberblock, we use it as the
 *   current uberblock for the pool by writing it to disk with an updated
 *   TXG, opening its version of the MOS, and moving on as usual from there.
 *   [see spa_ld_checkpoint_rewind()]
 *
 *   An important note on rewinding to the checkpoint has to do with how we
 *   handle ZIL blocks. In the scenario of a rewind, we clear out any ZIL
 *   blocks that have not been claimed by the time we took the checkpoint
 *   as they should no longer be valid.
 *   [see comment in zil_claim()]
 *
 * == Miscellaneous information ==
 *
 * - In the hypothetical event that we take a checkpoint, remove a vdev,
 *   and attempt to rewind, the rewind would fail as the checkpointed
 *   uberblock would reference data in the removed device. For this reason
 *   and others of similar nature, we disallow the following operations that
 *   can change the config:
 *   	vdev removal and attach/detach, mirror splitting, and pool reguid.
 *
 * - As most of the checkpoint logic is implemented in the SPA and doesn't
 *   distinguish datasets when it comes to space accounting, having a
 *   checkpoint can potentially break the boundaries set by dataset
 *   reservations.
