/*
 * This file contains the implementation of a re-entrant read
 * reader/writer lock (aka "rrwlock").
 *
 * This is a normal reader/writer lock with the additional feature
 * of allowing threads who have already obtained a read lock to
 * re-enter another read lock (re-entrant read) - even if there are
 * waiting writers.
 *
 * Callers who have not obtained a read lock give waiting writers priority.
 *
 * The rrwlock_t lock does not allow re-entrant writers, nor does it
 * allow a re-entrant mix of reads and writes (that is, it does not
 * allow a caller who has already obtained a read lock to be able to
 * then grab a write lock without first dropping all read locks, and
 * vice versa).
 *
 * The rrwlock_t uses tsd (thread specific data) to keep a list of
 * nodes (rrw_node_t), where each node keeps track of which specific
 * lock (rrw_node_t::rn_rrl) the thread has grabbed.  Since re-entering
 * should be rare, a thread that grabs multiple reads on the same rrwlock_t
 * will store multiple rrw_node_ts of the same 'rrn_rrl'. Nodes on the
 * tsd list can represent a different rrwlock_t.  This allows a thread
 * to enter multiple and unique rrwlock_ts for read locks at the same time.
 *
 * Since using tsd exposes some overhead, the rrwlock_t only needs to
 * keep tsd data when writers are waiting.  If no writers are waiting, then
 * a reader just bumps the anonymous read count (rr_anon_rcount) - no tsd
 * is needed.  Once a writer attempts to grab the lock, readers then
 * keep tsd data and bump the linked readers count (rr_linked_rcount).
 *
 * If there are waiting writers and there are anonymous readers, then a
 * reader doesn't know if it is a re-entrant lock. But since it may be one,
 * we allow the read to proceed (otherwise it could deadlock).  Since once
 * waiting writers are active, readers no longer bump the anonymous count,
 * the anonymous readers will eventually flush themselves out.  At this point,
 * readers will be able to tell if they are a re-entrant lock (have a
 * rrw_node_t entry for the lock) or not. If they are a re-entrant lock, then
 * we must let the proceed.  If they are not, then the reader blocks for the
 * waiting writers.  Hence, we do not starve writers.
