/*
 * Multi-Modifier Protection (MMP) attempts to prevent a user from importing
 * or opening a pool on more than one host at a time.  In particular, it
 * prevents "zpool import -f" on a host from succeeding while the pool is
 * already imported on another host.  There are many other ways in which a
 * device could be used by two hosts for different purposes at the same time
 * resulting in pool damage.  This implementation does not attempt to detect
 * those cases.
 *
 * MMP operates by ensuring there are frequent visible changes on disk (a
 * "heartbeat") at all times.  And by altering the import process to check
 * for these changes and failing the import when they are detected.  This
 * functionality is enabled by setting the 'multihost' pool property to on.
 *
 * Uberblocks written by the txg_sync thread always go into the first
 * (N-MMP_BLOCKS_PER_LABEL) slots, the remaining slots are reserved for MMP.
 * They are used to hold uberblocks which are exactly the same as the last
 * synced uberblock except that the ub_timestamp is frequently updated.
 * Like all other uberblocks, the slot is written with an embedded checksum,
 * and slots with invalid checksums are ignored.  This provides the
 * "heartbeat", with no risk of overwriting good uberblocks that must be
 * preserved, e.g. previous txgs and associated block pointers.
 *
 * Two optional fields are added to uberblock structure: ub_mmp_magic and
 * ub_mmp_delay.  The magic field allows zfs to tell whether ub_mmp_delay is
 * valid.  The delay field is a decaying average of the amount of time between
 * completion of successive MMP writes, in nanoseconds.  It is used to predict
 * how long the import must wait to detect activity in the pool, before
 * concluding it is not in use.
 *
 * During import an activity test may now be performed to determine if
 * the pool is in use.  The activity test is typically required if the
 * ZPOOL_CONFIG_HOSTID does not match the system hostid, the pool state is
 * POOL_STATE_ACTIVE, and the pool is not a root pool.
 *
 * The activity test finds the "best" uberblock (highest txg & timestamp),
 * waits some time, and then finds the "best" uberblock again.  If the txg
 * and timestamp in both "best" uberblocks do not match, the pool is in use
 * by another host and the import fails.  Since the granularity of the
 * timestamp is in seconds this activity test must take a bare minimum of one
 * second.  In order to assure the accuracy of the activity test, the default
 * values result in an activity test duration of 10x the mmp write interval.
 *
 * The "zpool import"  activity test can be expected to take a minimum time of
 * zfs_multihost_import_intervals * zfs_multihost_interval milliseconds.  If the
 * "best" uberblock has a valid ub_mmp_delay field, then the duration of the
 * test may take longer if MMP writes were occurring less frequently than
 * expected.  Additionally, the duration is then extended by a random 25% to
 * attempt to to detect simultaneous imports.  For example, if both partner
 * hosts are rebooted at the same time and automatically attempt to import the
 * pool.

/*
 * Used to control the frequency of mmp writes which are performed when the
 * 'multihost' pool property is on.  This is one factor used to determine the
 * length of the activity check during import.
 *
 * The mmp write period is zfs_multihost_interval / leaf-vdevs milliseconds.
 * This means that on average an mmp write will be issued for each leaf vdev
 * every zfs_multihost_interval milliseconds.  In practice, the observed period
 * can vary with the I/O load and this observed value is the delay which is
 * stored in the uberblock.  The minimum allowed value is 100 ms.
