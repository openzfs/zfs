/*
 * Aggregate-sum counters are a form of fanned-out counter, used when atomic
 * instructions on a single field cause enough CPU cache line contention to
 * slow system performance. Due to their increased overhead and the expense
 * involved with precisely reading from them, they should only be used in cases
 * where the write rate (increment/decrement) is much higher than the read rate
 * (get value).
 *
 * Aggregate sum counters are comprised of two basic parts, the core and the
 * buckets. The core counter contains a lock for the entire counter, as well
 * as the current upper and lower bounds on the value of the counter. The
 * aggsum_bucket structure contains a per-bucket lock to protect the contents of
 * the bucket, the current amount that this bucket has changed from the global
 * counter (called the delta), and the amount of increment and decrement we have
 * "borrowed" from the core counter.
 *
 * The basic operation of an aggsum is simple. Threads that wish to modify the
 * counter will modify one bucket's counter (determined by their current CPU, to
 * help minimize lock and cache contention). If the bucket already has
 * sufficient capacity borrowed from the core structure to handle their request,
 * they simply modify the delta and return.  If the bucket does not, we clear
 * the bucket's current state (to prevent the borrowed amounts from getting too
 * large), and borrow more from the core counter. Borrowing is done by adding to
 * the upper bound (or subtracting from the lower bound) of the core counter,
 * and setting the borrow value for the bucket to the amount added (or
 * subtracted).  Clearing the bucket is the opposite; we add the current delta
 * to both the lower and upper bounds of the core counter, subtract the borrowed
 * incremental from the upper bound, and add the borrowed decrement from the
 * lower bound.  Note that only borrowing and clearing require access to the
 * core counter; since all other operations access CPU-local resources,
 * performance can be much higher than a traditional counter.
 *
 * Threads that wish to read from the counter have a slightly more challenging
 * task. It is fast to determine the upper and lower bounds of the aggum; this
 * does not require grabbing any locks. This suffices for cases where an
 * approximation of the aggsum's value is acceptable. However, if one needs to
 * know whether some specific value is above or below the current value in the
 * aggsum, they invoke aggsum_compare(). This function operates by repeatedly
 * comparing the target value to the upper and lower bounds of the aggsum, and
 * then clearing a bucket. This proceeds until the target is outside of the
 * upper and lower bounds and we return a response, or the last bucket has been
 * cleared and we know that the target is equal to the aggsum's value. Finally,
 * the most expensive operation is determining the precise value of the aggsum.
 * To do this, we clear every bucket and then return the upper bound (which must
 * be equal to the lower bound). What makes aggsum_compare() and aggsum_value()
 * expensive is clearing buckets. This involves grabbing the global lock
 * (serializing against themselves and borrow operations), grabbing a bucket's
 * lock (preventing threads on those CPUs from modifying their delta), and
 * zeroing out the borrowed value (forcing that thread to borrow on its next
 * request, which will also be expensive).  This is what makes aggsums well
 * suited for write-many read-rarely operations.
