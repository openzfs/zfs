/*
 * While a standard mutex implementation has been available in the kernel
 * for quite some time.  It was not until 2.6.29 and latter kernels that
 * adaptive mutexs were embraced and integrated with the scheduler.  This
 * brought a significant performance improvement, but just as importantly
 * it added a lock owner to the generic mutex outside CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEXES
 * builds.  This is critical for correctly supporting the mutex_owner()
 * Solaris primitive.  When the owner is available we use a pure Linux
 * mutex implementation.  When the owner is not available we still use
 * Linux mutexs as a base but also reserve space for an owner field right
 * after the mutex structure.
 *
 * In the case when HAVE_MUTEX_OWNER is not defined your code may
 * still me able to leverage adaptive mutexs.  As long as the task_curr()
 * symbol is exported this code will provide a poor mans adaptive mutex
 * implementation.  However, this is not required and if the symbol is
 * unavailable we provide a standard mutex.
