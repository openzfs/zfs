Produced at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory<br />
Ported by <a href="mailto:behlendorf1@llnl.gov">Brian Behlendorf</a><br />
LLNL-CODE-403049.</p>

<p>The majority of the code in the Native ZFS for Linux port comes
from OpenSolaris which has been released under the terms of the <a
href="http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Main/opensolaris_license">CDDL</a>
open source license.  This includes the core ZFS code, libavl, libnvpair,
libefi, libunicode, and libutil.  The original OpenSolaris source can be
downloaded from:</p>

<p>Files which do not originate from OpenSolaris are noted in the file
header and attributed properly.  These exceptions include, but are not limited
to, the vdev_disk.c and zvol.c implementation which are licensed under the <a
href="http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Main/opensolaris_license">CDDL</a>.</p>

<p>The zpios test code is originally derived from the Lustre
pios test code which is licensed under the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a>.  As such the heavily
modified zpios kernel test code also remains licensed under the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a>.</p>
