<p>The zfs regression test suite is broken in to several smaller groups
of tests.  Some of these scripts run relatively quickly such as
<em>zconfig.sh</em> others such as <em>zfault.sh</em> can take
considerably more time.  These tests are only to validate the
correctness of the packages you just built.  The scripts are part of
the zfs-test package which is optional to install.  If you do install
the zfs-test package you will also need to install the parted and lsscsi
packages.  Finally, make sure the scsi_debug module has been built for
your kernel and is available.

<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install parted lsscsi
$ modinfo scsi_debug
</pre>

or

<pre>
$ sudo yum install parted lsscsi
$ modinfo scsi_debug
</pre>

<p>The first test you&#8217;ll want to run is called <em>zconfig.sh</em>
which validates that the zfs utilities are working properly.  Once that
passes you will want to run <em>zpios-sanity.sh</em> which will create
several zpool configurations and verify IO is working properly.  Finally,
there is the much longer running <em>zfault.sh</em> which simulates
various common failure modes and ensures they are handled correctly.
For the moment I would advise skipping the <em>zfault.sh</em> regression
tests.  The test suite still contains several known false positives, these
are flaws in the tests, not in zfs.  Additionally, you may not be able
to run <em>zfault.sh</em> on older kernels because it relies on certainly
newer kernel features to simulate the failures.</p>

<p>All of these test suites use loopback devices or files in /tmp/ to back
the zpool so none of your real system data is at risk.  This does mean the
regression test suite requires roughly 1GiB of free space in /tmp/.  These
tests will need to be run as root since you are loading several kernel
modules.  If you do observe a failure please record as much debug
information as possible and open an
<a href="http://github.com/behlendorf/zfs/issues">issue</a> so it can be
fixed.</p>
