<p>The focus of this project at
<a href="https://computing.llnl.gov/">Livermore</a> has been to port the
ZFS DMU to the Linux kernel as a replacement back-end for ldiskfs.  Oracle
is also keenly aware of
<a href="http://wiki.lustre.org/index.php/ZFS_and_Lustre">
ldiskfs&#8217;s limitations</a> and has been working to integrate ZFS with
Lustre on Solaris.  For very large systems there is a recognition that a ZFS
based back-end is required to meet the scaling and performance demands of
large production clusters.  We would love to see the
<a href="example-zpl.html">ZFS posix layer finished</a> as well but it is
not a critical part of our plans in the near term.</p>

<p>In particular, ZFS&#8217;s advanced architecture addresses two of our
key performance concerns: random I/O, and small I/O.  In a large cluster
environment a Lustre I/O server (OSS) can be expected to generate a random
I/O workload.  There will be 100&#8217;s of threads concurrently accessing
different files in the back-end file system.  For writes ZFS&#8217;s
copy-on-write transaction model converts this random workload in to a
streaming workload which is critical when using SATA disks.  For small I/O,
Lustre can leverage a ZIL placed on separate SSD devices to maximize
performance.</p>

<p>Our intention is to deploy a 50 petabyte production Lustre file system
based on this Linux ZFS port.  With that much hardware on the floor
failures of all parts of the system occur on a regular basis.  For this
reason, ZFS&#8217;s ability to detect and repair data corruption online is a
critical feature for us.  This includes cleanly handling many different
failure modes without the need for an offline file system check.</p>

<p>To prove we can successfully deploy a Lustre file system of this size
based on a Linux port of ZFS, we have purchased a full storage scalable
unit (SSU) of our target hardware for development and testing.  An SSU is our
fundamental building block when designing a Lustre file system.  The idea is
to add as many SSUs as needed to reach the design target for the system.  Our
Lustre ZFS SSU looks like this, and this hardware is being used to stabilize
this code base for production use.</p>
