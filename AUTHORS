Brian Behlendorf is the principle developer of the ZFS on Linux port.
He works full time as a computer scientist at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory on the ZFS and Lustre filesystems.  However,
this port would not have been possible without the help of many
others who have contributed their time, effort, and insight.

First and foremost the hard working ZFS developers at Sun/Oracle.
They are responsible for the bulk of the code in this project and
without their efforts there never would have been a ZFS filesystem.

Next all the developers at KQ Infotech who implemented a working
ZFS Posix Layer (ZPL) for this port.  Their implementation provided
an excellent reference for adding the missing ZPL functionality.
