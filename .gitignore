#
# This is the top-level .gitignore file:
# ignore everything except a list of allowed files.
#
# This is not the place for entries that are specific to
# a subdirectory.  Instead add those files to the
# .gitignore file in that subdirectory.
#
# N.B.
# Please use 'git ls-files -i --exclude-standard'
# command after changing this file, to see if there are
# any tracked files which get ignored after the change.
