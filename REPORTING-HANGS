If you encounter a system hang that appears to be related to ZFSOnLinux, please
file an issue in the github tracker:

https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/issues/new

Please include the following information:

0. The workload that the system was running. For example, clients were
communicating with a Samba server configured to use AIO.

1. The system pool configuration. This is usually contained within the output
of `zdb`. Also, whether or not the system uses ECC.

2. The Linux distribution, the release version of the Linux distribution, Linux
kernel version, ZFSOnLinux ZFS and SPL versions.

3. If possible, the kernel configuration file. e.g. `zcat /proc/config.gz`

4. If possible, the output of `for i in /proc/*/stack; do echo $i; cat $i;
done;` and `ps -ef` during the hang.

5. If possible, any storage related dmesg output during the hang. This includes
backtraces from hung threads. Note that backtraces from hung threads in dmesg
rarely contain the cause of a hang because of asynchronous communication within
the kernel, but such backtraces would be helpful in analyzing the information
you provide for #3. If you are not sure what is related to ZFS, you should
provide the full contents of dmesg for analysis.

6. If possible, the contents of /proc/spl/kstat/zfs/arcstats and
/proc/spl/kmem/slab during the hang.

7. If you are comfortable providing it, the output of `zfs get all` and the
specific names of the datasets/zvols involved in your workload would also be
useful in enabling the developers to understand your system configuration and
diagnose issues.

8. Any other information that appears to be relevant.

The various files and commands mentioned contain a large amount of data. You
should use a service such as github's gist service to post the details from
them to ensure that reports are easily read by the developers:
