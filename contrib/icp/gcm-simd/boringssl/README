This directory contains the original BoringSSL [1] GCM x86-64 assembly
files [2].

The assembler files where then further modified to fit the ICP conventions.

The main purpose to include these files (and the original ones) here, is to
serve as a reference if upstream changes need to be applied to the files
included and modified in the ICP.
