This directory contains the ported "Intel(R) Intelligent Storage Acceleration
Library Crypto Version" [1] GCM x86-64 assembly files [2]. They were adapted
for the GNU assembler and translated to AT&T syntax. The later was necessary to
support LLVM clangs integrated assembler. It was verified that the ported
versions still pass the GCM tests in the isa-l_crypto source tree. The original
files can be found in the isa-l_crypto directory one level up.

The ported assembler files where then further adapted to be used within the
ICP.

The main purpose to include these files (and the original ones) here, is to
serve as a reference if upstream changes need to be applied to the files
included and modified in the ICP. They could be used by other projects
depending on the GNU or LLVM assemblers as a starting point as well.
