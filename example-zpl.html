<p><b>A development version of the ZFS Posix Layer (ZPL) is
now available!</b></p>

<p>This is the functionality you need to be able to mount ZFS
like a normal Linux filesystem.  All the core functionality is
in place but several of the advanced features still need to be
implemented.  My hope is that by making this code available before
it is 100% feature complete the Linux ZFS community can contribute
to finishing the missing features.  You can download the latest
release candidate here:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/downloads/behlendorf/spl/spl-0.6.0-rc2.tar.gz">spl-0.6.0-rc2</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/downloads/behlendorf/zfs/zfs-0.6.0-rc2.tar.gz">zfs-0.6.0-rc2</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Before downloading the source you should be aware of two things.</p>
<ol>
  <li> The latest release candidate <i>only</i> supports 2.6.31-2.6.38
based Linux kernels.  This currently covers most of the default kernels
used by the major distributions.</li>
  <li> This is a release candidate and not production release.  That
means that while the code is functional and stable, there are still
rough edges.  I have intentionally released this code as soon as it
was reasonable to do so.  My hope is that it will help foster more
community involvement.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you're not comfortable running a release candidate and you absolutely
need to have ZFS on Linux today.  There is an alternate implementation
of the ZPL which was produced by <a href="http://kqinfotech.com/">
KQ Infotech</a>.  You can download their implementation from
<a href=http://kqstor.com>kqstor.com</a>.  Their port is based
of the spl/zfs-0.5.2 version so it <i>does</i> include features such
as deduplication.</p>

<p>We would also love to see a FUSE based implementation.
Currently all the zfs code in this project builds cleanly in the
kernel as a module and in user space as a dynamic library used by
ztest.  Getting this code base working with zfs-fuse should mainly
be a matter of adding the needed FUSE bits which the
<a href="http://zfs-fuse.net/">ZFS-FUSE folks</a> clearly showed
us can be done!  It would be very nice from a development standpoint
if these two projects could share a common code base.</p>
