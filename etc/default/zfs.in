# NOTE: This file is intended for sysv init and initramfs.
# Changing some of these settings may not make any difference on
# systemd-based setup, e.g. setting ZFS_MOUNT=no will not prevent systemd
# from launching zfs-mount.service during boot.
# See: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=901436

# To enable a boolean setting, set it to yes, on, true, or 1.

# By default, a verbatim import of all pools is performed at boot based on the
# contents of the default zpool cache file.  The contents of the cache are
# managed automatically by the 'zpool import' and 'zpool export' commands.
#
# By setting this to 'yes', the system will instead search all devices for
# pools and attempt to import them all at boot, even those that have been
# exported.  Under this mode, the search path can be controlled by the
# ZPOOL_IMPORT_PATH variable and a list of pools that should not be imported
# can be listed in the ZFS_POOL_EXCEPTIONS variable.
#
# Note that importing all visible pools may include pools that you don't
# expect, such as those on removable devices and SANs, and those pools may
# proceed to mount themselves in places you do not want them to.  The results
# can be unpredictable and possibly dangerous.  Only enable this option if you
# understand this risk and have complete physical control over your system and
# SAN to prevent the insertion of malicious pools.

# Specify specific path(s) to look for device nodes and/or links for the
# pool import(s). See zpool(8) for more information about this variable.
# It supersedes the old USE_DISK_BY_ID which indicated that it would only

# The old variable will still work in the code, but is deprecated.

# A mount counter will be used when mounting if set to 'yes'.

# is not allowed).

# Any additional option to the 'zfs import' commandline?
# Include '-o' for each option wanted.
# You don't need to put '-f' in here, unless you want it ALL the time.
# Using the option 'zfsforce=1' on the grub/kernel command line will
# do the same, but on a case-to-case basis.

#
# Setting ZPOOL_CACHE to an empty string ('') AND setting ZPOOL_IMPORT_OPTS to
# "-c @sysconfdir@/zfs/zpool.cache" will _enforce_ the use of a cache file.
# This is needed in some cases (extreme amounts of VDEVs, multipath etc).
# Generally, the use of a cache file is usually not recommended on Linux
# because it sometimes is more trouble than it's worth (laptops with external
# devices or when/if device nodes changes names).
