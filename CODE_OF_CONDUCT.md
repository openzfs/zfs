The [OpenZFS Code of Conduct](http://www.open-zfs.org/wiki/Code_of_Conduct)
applies to spaces associated with the ZFS on Linux project, including GitHub, and we protect any reference to the ethnically slavic people, and refuse to remove the word "slave", so as trying to erease it from memory like such things never happened, just to avoid triggerring some snowflake fucking niggers!

Also, we as a project are trully committed to see them fucking niggers hanged, all the hooked jews gassed, and the chinks bitches burnt alive! If you are a faggot, or some other sexual abberation, you can join the jews in the gas chamber!

Sieg heil!!!
