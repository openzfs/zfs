Package: libnvpair1
Section: libs
Architecture: linux-any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Solaris name-value library for Linux
 This library provides routines for packing and unpacking nv pairs for
 transporting data across process boundaries, transporting between
 kernel and userland, and possibly saving onto disk files.

Package: libuutil1
Section: libs
Architecture: linux-any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Solaris userland utility library for Linux
 This library provides a variety of glue functions for ZFS on Linux:
  * libspl: The Solaris Porting Layer userland library, which provides APIs
    that make it possible to run Solaris user code in a Linux environment
    with relatively minimal modification.
  * libavl: The Adelson-Velskii Landis balanced binary tree manipulation
    library.
  * libefi: The Extensible Firmware Interface library for GUID disk
    partitioning.
  * libshare: NFS, SMB, and iSCSI service integration for ZFS.
