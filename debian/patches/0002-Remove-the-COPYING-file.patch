Subject: [PATCH 2/7] Remove the COPYING file.

Resolve this lintian warning by removing the COPYING file:

	W: zfsutils: extra-license-file usr/share/doc/zfsutils/COPYING
	N:
	N:    All license information should be collected in the debian/copyright
	N:    file. This usually makes it unnecessary for the package to install this
	N:    information in other places as well.
	N:
	N:    Refer to Debian Policy Manual section 12.5 (Copyright information) for
	N:    details.
	N:
	N:    Severity: normal, Certainty: possible
	N:

The COPYING file in this project is a place holder that does not
contain the software license, and it is optional for autotools
because the automake template is "foreign".
