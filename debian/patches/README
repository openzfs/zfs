To add a patch:

	$ git checkout debian-patches
	$ git fetch <topic_branch>
	$ git cherry-pick <commit>

To remove a patch:

	$ git checkout debian-patches
	$ git rebase -i upstream
	: delete the commit line in the interactive editor

To reorder the series:

	$ git checkout debian-patches
	$ git rebase -i upstream
	: rearrange the commit lines in the interactive editor

To refresh the series for release:

	$ git checkout master
	$ cd debian/patches
	$ rm 0*.patch
	$ git format-patch upstream..debian-patches
	$ ls -1 0*.patch volatile-version.patch >series

The reasons for keeping debian/patches in a separate branch are:

  * Using git to automatically rediff the patches is easier than using
    `quilt refresh` and manually resolving conflicts.

  * It is faster to pull and later discard experimental topic branches.

  * It keeps the packaging master history clean and concise, and avoids
    accidentally conflating the upstream master. Reverting a commit that
    changed something outside of the debian/ overlay is ugly.
