 .
 3. Distribution Obligations.
 .
 3.1. Availability of Source Code.
 .
 Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in
 Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source
 Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must
 include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the
 Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform
 recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can
 obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
 through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
 .
 3.2. Modifications.
 .
 The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by
 the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications
 are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the
 rights conveyed by this License.
 .
 3.3. Required Notices.
 .
 You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as
 the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright,
 patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any
 notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any
 Contributor or the Initial Developer.
 .
 3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
 .
 You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code
 form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
 recipients’ rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
 warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients
 of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
 behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
 clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
 offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
 and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
 such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms
 You offer.
 .
 3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
 .
 You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms
 of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may
 contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance
 with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form
 does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient’s rights in the Source Code
 form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
 Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it
 absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by
 You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to
 indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
 incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
 terms You offer.
 .
 3.6. Larger Works.
 .
 You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not
 governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a
 single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
 License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.
 .
 4. Versions of the License.
 .
 4.1. New Versions.
 .
 Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised
 and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be
 given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no
 one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.
 .
 4.2. Effect of New Versions.
 .
 You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
 Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which
 You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes
 a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or
 otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must
 distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
 version of the License under which You originally received the Covered
 Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make
 the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the
 License published by the license steward.
 .
 4.3. Modified Versions.
 .
 When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your
 Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if
 You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the
 license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License);
 and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ
 from this License.
 .
 5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
 .
 COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT
 WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
 LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
 MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK
 AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD
 ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL
 DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
 REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART
 OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT
 UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
 .
 6. TERMINATION.
 .
 6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
 if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30
 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must
 remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
 .
 6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment
 actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or
 Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as “Participant”)
 alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where
 the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant
 is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any
 and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the
 Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all
 Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
 notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
 expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period
 You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such
 Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
 Participant.
 .
 6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user
 licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
 prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)
 shall survive termination.
 .
 7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
 .
 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
 NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
 OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF
 ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
 INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
 LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
 FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN
 IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
 INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
 PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
 LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
 LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
 .
 The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48
 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” (as that
 term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer
 software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through
 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software
 with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is
 in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision
 that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.
 .
 9. MISCELLANEOUS.
 .
 This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
 hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
 provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
 enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction
 specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the
 extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
 jurisdiction’s conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
 License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the
 jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original
 Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
 limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses. The
 application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
 Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that
 the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
 apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance
 with the United States export administration regulations (and the export
 control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or
 otherwise make available any Covered Software.
 .
 10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
 .
 As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
 for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization
 of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and
 Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
 herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
