zfs-linux (0.6.0.34-0ubuntu1) oneiric; urgency=low

  * The PPA for ZFS is moving.
 
  The ppa:dajhorn/zfs archive is deprecated because the ZFS project
  now has a team account at Launchpad. Use the ppa:zfs-native/stable
  archive instead.

  Please visit: https://launchpad.net/~zfs-native/

zfs-linux (0.6.0.7-0ubuntu2) unstable; urgency=medium

  NOTE:  The removal of the zfs or zfs-lib package by this
         upgrade, either now or later, is expected and safe.

  Please ensure that the ubuntu-zfs package is installed so
  that the upgrade happens automatically.

  This is happening so that the ZFS packages for Linux are
  more like the packages already in Debian kFreeBSD.
