#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	Invoke "zfs mount <filesystem>" with a filesystem
#	which mountpoint be the identical or the top of an existing one,
#	it will fail with a return code of 1
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Prepare an existing mounted filesystem.
#	2. Setup a new filesystem and make sure that it is unmounted.
#       3. Mount the new filesystem using the various combinations
#		- zfs set mountpoint=<identical path> <filesystem>
#		- zfs set mountpoint=<top path> <filesystem>
#       4. Verify that mount failed with return code of 1.
