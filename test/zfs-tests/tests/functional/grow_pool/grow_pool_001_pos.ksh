#
# DESCRIPTION:
# A ZFS file system is limited by the amount of disk space
# available to the pool. Growing the pool by adding a disk
# increases the amount of space.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1) Fill a ZFS filesystem until ENOSPC by creating a large file
# 2) Grow the pool by adding a disk
# 3) Verify that more data can now be written to the file system
#
