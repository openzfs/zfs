# DESCRIPTION:
#	Verifies that cp will not be able to include file attribute when
#	attribute is unreadable (unless the user is root)
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. In directory A, create several files and add attribute files for them
#	2. chmod all files'the attribute files to '000'.
#	3. Implement 'cp -@p' to files.
#	4. Verify attribute files are not existing for non-root user.
