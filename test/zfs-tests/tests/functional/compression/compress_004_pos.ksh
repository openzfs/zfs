# DESCRIPTION:
# With 'compression' set, a file with non-power-of-2 blocksize storage space
# can be freed as will normally.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Set 'compression' or 'compress' to on or lzjb
#	2. Set different recordsize with ZFS filesystem
#	3. Repeatedly using 'randfree_file' to create a file and then free its
#	   storage space with different range, the system should work normally.
