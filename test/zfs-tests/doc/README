ZFS Test Suite README

3. Test results

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Building and installing the ZFS Test Suite

The ZFS Test Suite runs under the testrunner framework (which can be installed
as pkg:/system/test/testrunner). To build both the ZFS Test Suite and the
testrunner without running a full nightly:

	build_machine$ bldenv [-d] <your_env_file>
	build_machine$ cd $SRC/test
	build_machine$ dmake install
	build_machine$ cd $SRC/pkg
	build_machine$ dmake install

Then set the publisher on the test machine to point to your repository and
install the ZFS Test Suite.

	test_machine# pkg install pkg:/system/test/zfstest

Note, the framework will be installed automatically, as the ZFS Test Suite
depends on it.

2. Running the ZFS Test Suite

The pre-requisites for running the ZFS Test Suite are:
	- Three scratch disks
	  - Specify the disks you wish to use in the $DISKS variable, as a
	    space delimited list like this: DISKS='c3t1d0 c3t2d0 c3t3d0'
	  - Use the '-a' option to the zfstest script and all unused disks on
	    the system are eligible. With '-a' specified, $DISKS is ignored.
	- A non-root user with the full set of basic privileges and the ability
	  to sudo(1M) to root without a password to run the test.
	- Specify any pools you wish to preserve as a space delimited list in
	  the $KEEP variable. The root pool is added automatically.

Once the pre-requisites are satisfied, simply run the zfstest script:

	test_machine$ /opt/zfs-tests/bin/zfstest [-aq]

When the '-q' option is specified, it is passed to run(1) which causes output
to be written to the console only for tests that do not pass and the results
summary.

The ZFS Test Suite allows the user to specify a subset of the tests via a
runfile. The format of the runfile is explained in run(1), and the files that
zfstest uses are available for reference under /opt/zfs-tests/runfiles. To
specify a custom runfile, use the -c option:

	test_machine$ /opt/zfs-tests/bin/zfstest [-aq] -c my_tests.run

3. Test results

While the ZFS Test Suite is running, one informational line is printed at the
end of each test, and a results summary is printed at the end of the run. The
results summary includes the location of the complete logs, which is of the
form /var/tmp/test_results/<ISO 8601 date>.
