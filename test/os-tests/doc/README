OS Unit Test Suite README

2. Running the OS Unit Test Suite
3. Test results

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Building and installing the OS Unit Test Suite

The OS Unit Test Suite runs under the testrunner framework (which can be
installed as pkg:/system/test/testrunner). To build both the OS Unit Test Suite
and the testrunner without running a full nightly:

	build_machine$ bldenv [-d] <your_env_file>
	build_machine$ cd $SRC/test
	build_machine$ dmake install
	build_machine$ cd $SRC/pkg
	build_machine$ dmake install

Then set the publisher on the test machine to point to your repository and
install the OS Unit Test Suite.

	test_machine# pkg install pkg:/system/test/zfstest

Note, the framework will be installed automatically, as the OS Unit Test Suite
depends on it.

2. Running the OS Unit Test Suite

The pre-requisites for running the OS Unit Test Suite are:
	- A non-root user with the ability to sudo(1M) to root without a
	  password or the root user must run the test.

Once the pre-requisites are satisfied, simply run the ostest script:

	test_machine$ /opt/os-tests/bin/ostest

3. Test results

While the OS Unit Test Suite is running, one informational line is printed at
the end of each test, and a results summary is printed at the end of the run.
The results summary includes the location of the complete logs, which is of the
form /var/tmp/test_results/<ISO 8601 date>.
