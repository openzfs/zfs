1. What the Utils Unit Test Suite tests

The Utils unit test suite is for testing standard shell / POSIX utilities.
For example utilities such as "printf" are tested.

2. Building and installing the Utils Unit Test Suite

The Utils Unit Test Suite runs under the testrunner framework (which can be
installed as pkg:/system/test/testrunner). To build both the Utils Unit Test
Suite and the testrunner without running a full nightly:

	build_machine$ bldenv [-d] <your_env_file>
	build_machine$ cd $SRC/test
	build_machine$ dmake install
	build_machine$ cd $SRC/pkg
	build_machine$ dmake install

Then set the publisher on the test machine to point to your repository and
install the Utils Unit Test Suite.

	test_machine# pkg install pkg:/system/test/utiltest

Note, the framework will be installed automatically, as the Utils Unit Test
Suite depends on it.

3. Running the Utils Unit Test Suite

The pre-requisites for running the OS Unit Test Suite are:
	- Any user may perform these tests.

Once the pre-requisites are satisfied, simply run the ostest script:

	test_machine$ /opt/util-tests/bin/utiltest

4. Test results

While the OS Unit Test Suite is running, one informational line is printed at
the end of each test, and a results summary is printed at the end of the run.
The results summary includes the location of the complete logs, which is of the
form /var/tmp/test_results/<ISO 8601 date>.
