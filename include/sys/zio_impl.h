/*
 * XXX -- Describe ZFS I/O pipeline here. Fill in as needed.
 *
 * The ZFS I/O pipeline is comprised of various stages which are defined
 * in the zio_stage enum below. The individual stages are used to construct
 * these basic I/O operations: Read, Write, Free, Claim, and Ioctl.
 *
 * I/O operations: (XXX - provide detail for each of the operations)
 *
 * Read:
 * Write:
 * Free:
 * Claim:
 * Ioctl:
 *
 * Although the most common pipeline are used by the basic I/O operations
 * above, there are some helper pipelines (one could consider them
 * sub-pipelines) which are used internally by the ZIO module and are
 * explained below:
 *
 * Interlock Pipeline:
 * The interlock pipeline is the most basic pipeline and is used by all
 * of the I/O operations. The interlock pipeline does not perform any I/O
 * and is used to coordinate the dependencies between I/Os that are being
 * issued (i.e. the parent/child relationship).
 *
 * Vdev child Pipeline:
 * The vdev child pipeline is responsible for performing the physical I/O.
 * It is in this pipeline where the I/O are queued and possibly cached.
 *
 * In addition to performing I/O, the pipeline is also responsible for
 * data transformations. The transformations performed are based on the
 * specific properties that user may have selected and modify the
 * behavior of the pipeline. Examples of supported transformations are
 * compression, dedup, and nop writes. Transformations will either modify
 * the data or the pipeline. This list below further describes each of
 * the supported transformations:
 *
 * Compression:
 * ZFS supports three different flavors of compression -- gzip, lzjb, and
 * zle. Compression occurs as part of the write pipeline and is performed
 * in the ZIO_STAGE_WRITE_BP_INIT stage.
 *
 * Dedup:
 * Dedup reads are handled by the ZIO_STAGE_DDT_READ_START and
 * ZIO_STAGE_DDT_READ_DONE stages. These stages are added to an existing
 * read pipeline if the dedup bit is set on the block pointer.
 * Writing a dedup block is performed by the ZIO_STAGE_DDT_WRITE stage
 * and added to a write pipeline if a user has enabled dedup on that
 * particular dataset.
 *
 * NOP Write:
 * The NOP write feature is performed by the ZIO_STAGE_NOP_WRITE stage
 * and is added to an existing write pipeline if a crypographically
 * secure checksum (i.e. SHA256) is enabled and compression is turned on.
 * The NOP write stage will compare the checksums of the current data
 * on-disk (level-0 blocks only) and the data that is currently being written.
 * If the checksum values are identical then the pipeline is converted to
 * an interlock pipeline skipping block allocation and bypassing the
 * physical I/O.  The nop write feature can handle writes in either
 * syncing or open context (i.e. zil writes) and as a result is mutually
 * exclusive with dedup.
