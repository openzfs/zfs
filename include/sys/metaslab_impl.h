 * The metaslab weight is used to encode the amount of free space in a

 * metaslabs by weight. The weight (and therefore the "best" metaslab) can
 * be determined in two different ways: by computing a weighted sum of all
 * the free space in the metaslab (a space based weight) or by counting only
 * the free segments of the largest size (a segment based weight). We prefer
 * the segment based weight because it reflects how the free space is
 * comprised, but we cannot always use it -- legacy pools do not have the
 * space map histogram information necessary to determine the largest
 * contiguous regions. Pools that have the space map histogram determine
 * the segment weight by looking at each bucket in the histogram and
 * determining the free space whose size in bytes is in the range:
 *	[2^i, 2^(i+1))
 * We then encode the largest index, i, that contains regions into the
 * segment-weighted value.

 * A metaslab class encompasses a category of allocatable top-level vdevs.

 * "normal" for data block allocations (i.e. main pool allocations) or "log"
 * for allocations designated for intent log devices (i.e. slog devices).
 * When a block allocation is requested from the SPA it is associated with a
 * metaslab_class_t, and only top-level vdevs (i.e. metaslab groups) belonging
 * to the class can be used to satisfy that request. Allocations are done
 * by traversing the metaslab groups that are linked off of the mc_rotor field.
 * This rotor points to the next metaslab group where allocations will be
 * attempted. Allocating a block is a 3 step process -- select the metaslab
 * group, select the metaslab, and then allocate the block. The metaslab
 * class defines the low-level block allocator that will be used as the
 * final step in allocation. These allocators are pluggable allowing each class

/*
 * Each metaslab maintains a set of in-core trees to track metaslab
 * operations.  The in-core free tree (ms_allocatable) contains the list of
 * free segments which are eligible for allocation.  As blocks are
 * allocated, the allocated segment are removed from the ms_allocatable and
 * added to a per txg allocation tree (ms_allocating).  As blocks are
 * freed, they are added to the free tree (ms_freeing).  These trees
 * allow us to process all allocations and frees in syncing context
 * where it is safe to update the on-disk space maps.  An additional set
 * of in-core trees is maintained to track deferred frees
 * (ms_defer).  Once a block is freed it will move from the
 * ms_freed to the ms_defer tree.  A deferred free means that a block
 * has been freed but cannot be used by the pool until TXG_DEFER_SIZE
 * transactions groups later.  For example, a block that is freed in txg
 * 50 will not be available for reallocation until txg 52 (50 +
 * TXG_DEFER_SIZE).  This provides a safety net for uberblock rollback.
 * A pool could be safely rolled back TXG_DEFERS_SIZE transactions
 * groups and ensure that no block has been reallocated.
 *
 * The simplified transition diagram looks like this:
 *
 *
 *      ALLOCATE
 *         |
 *         V
 *    free segment (ms_allocatable) -> ms_allocating[4] -> (write to space map)
 *         ^
 *         |                        ms_freeing <--- FREE
 *         |                             |
 *         |                             v
 *         |                         ms_freed
 *         |                             |
 *         +-------- ms_defer[2] <-------+-------> (write to space map)
 *
 *
 * Each metaslab's space is tracked in a single space map in the MOS,
 * which is only updated in syncing context.  Each time we sync a txg,
 * we append the allocs and frees from that txg to the space map.  The
 * pool space is only updated once all metaslabs have finished syncing.
 *
 * To load the in-core free tree we read the space map from disk.  This
 * object contains a series of alloc and free records that are combined
 * to make up the list of all free segments in this metaslab.  These
 * segments are represented in-core by the ms_allocatable and are stored
 * in an AVL tree.
 *
 * As the space map grows (as a result of the appends) it will
 * eventually become space-inefficient.  When the metaslab's in-core
 * free tree is zfs_condense_pct/100 times the size of the minimal
 * on-disk representation, we rewrite it in its minimized form.  If a
 * metaslab needs to condense then we must set the ms_condensing flag to
 * ensure that allocations are not performed on the metaslab that is
 * being written.
