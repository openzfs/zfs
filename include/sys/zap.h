/*
 * ZAP - ZFS Attribute Processor
 *
 * The ZAP is a module which sits on top of the DMU (Data Management
 * Unit) and implements a higher-level storage primitive using DMU
 * objects.  Its primary consumer is the ZPL (ZFS Posix Layer).
 *
 * A "zapobj" is a DMU object which the ZAP uses to stores attributes.
 * Users should use only zap routines to access a zapobj - they should
 * not access the DMU object directly using DMU routines.
 *
 * The attributes stored in a zapobj are name-value pairs.  The name is
 * a zero-terminated string of up to ZAP_MAXNAMELEN bytes (including
 * terminating NULL).  The value is an array of integers, which may be
 * 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes long.  The total space used by the array (number
 * of integers * integer length) can be up to ZAP_MAXVALUELEN bytes.
 * Note that an 8-byte integer value can be used to store the location
 * (object number) of another dmu object (which may be itself a zapobj).
 * Note that you can use a zero-length attribute to store a single bit
 * of information - the attribute is present or not.
 *
 * The ZAP routines are thread-safe.  However, you must observe the
 * DMU's restriction that a transaction may not be operated on
 * concurrently.
 *
 * Any of the routines that return an int may return an I/O error (EIO
 * or ECHECKSUM).
 *
 *
 * Implementation / Performance Notes:
 *
 * The ZAP is intended to operate most efficiently on attributes with
 * short (49 bytes or less) names and single 8-byte values, for which
 * the microzap will be used.  The ZAP should be efficient enough so
 * that the user does not need to cache these attributes.
 *
 * The ZAP's locking scheme makes its routines thread-safe.  Operations
 * on different zapobjs will be processed concurrently.  Operations on
 * the same zapobj which only read data will be processed concurrently.
 * Operations on the same zapobj which modify data will be processed
 * concurrently when there are many attributes in the zapobj (because
 * the ZAP uses per-block locking - more than 128 * (number of cpus)
 * small attributes will suffice).
 */

/*
 * We're using zero-terminated byte strings (ie. ASCII or UTF-8 C
 * strings) for the names of attributes, rather than a byte string
 * bounded by an explicit length.  If some day we want to support names
 * in character sets which have embedded zeros (eg. UTF-16, UTF-32),
 * we'll have to add routines for using length-bounded strings.
