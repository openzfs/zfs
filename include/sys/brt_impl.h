 * 128MB array of entcounts into 32kB disk blocks, as we don't want to update
 * the whole 128MB on disk when we have updated only a single entcount.
 * We maintain a bitmap where each 32kB disk block within 128MB entcounts array
 * is represented by a single bit. This gives us 4096 bits. A set bit in the
