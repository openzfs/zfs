 * Note that buffers can be in one of 6 states:
 *	ARC_anon	- anonymous (discussed below)
 *	ARC_mru		- recently used, currently cached
 *	ARC_mru_ghost	- recently used, no longer in cache
 *	ARC_mfu		- frequently used, currently cached
 *	ARC_mfu_ghost	- frequently used, no longer in cache
 *	ARC_l2c_only	- exists in L2ARC but not other states
 * When there are no active references to the buffer, they are
 * are linked onto a list in one of these arc states.  These are
 * the only buffers that can be evicted or deleted.  Within each
 * state there are multiple lists, one for meta-data and one for
 * non-meta-data.  Meta-data (indirect blocks, blocks of dnodes,
 * etc.) is tracked separately so that it can be managed more
 * explicitly: favored over data, limited explicitly.
 *
 * Anonymous buffers are buffers that are not associated with
 * a DVA.  These are buffers that hold dirty block copies
 * before they are written to stable storage.  By definition,
 * they are "ref'd" and are considered part of arc_mru
 * that cannot be freed.  Generally, they will acquire a DVA
 * as they are written and migrate onto the arc_mru list.
 *
 * The ARC_l2c_only state is for buffers that are in the second
 * level ARC but no longer in any of the ARC_m* lists.  The second
 * level ARC itself may also contain buffers that are in any of
 * the ARC_m* states - meaning that a buffer can exist in two
 * places.  The reason for the ARC_l2c_only state is to keep the
 * buffer header in the hash table, so that reads that hit the
 * second level ARC benefit from these fast lookups.
