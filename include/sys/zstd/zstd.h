/*
 * So, the reason we have all these complicated set/get functions is that
 * originally, in the zstd "header" we wrote out to disk, we used a 32-bit
 * bitfield to store the "level" (8 bits) and "version" (24 bits).
 *
 * Unfortunately, bitfields make few promises about how they're arranged in
 * memory...
 *
 * By way of example, if we were using version 1.4.5 and level 3, it'd be
 * level = 0x03, version = 10405/0x0028A5, which gets broken into Vhigh = 0x00,
 * Vmid = 0x28, Vlow = 0xA5. We include these positions below to help follow
 * which data winds up where.
 *
 * As a consequence, we wound up with little endian platforms with a layout
 * like this in memory:
 *
 *      0       8      16      24      32
 *      +-------+-------+-------+-------+
 *      | Vlow  | Vmid  | Vhigh | level |
 *      +-------+-------+-------+-------+
 *        =A5     =28     =00     =03
 *
 * ...and then, after being run through BE_32(), serializing this out to
 * disk:
 *
 *      0       8      16      24      32
 *      +-------+-------+-------+-------+
 *      | level | Vhigh | Vmid  | Vlow  |
 *      +-------+-------+-------+-------+
 *        =03     =00     =28     =A5
 *
 * while on big-endian systems, since BE_32() is a noop there, both in
 * memory and on disk, we wind up with:
 *
 *      0       8      16      24      32
 *      +-------+-------+-------+-------+
 *      | Vhigh | Vmid  | Vlow  | level |
 *      +-------+-------+-------+-------+
 *        =00     =28     =A5     =03
 *
 * (Vhigh is always 0 until version exceeds 6.55.35. Vmid and Vlow are the
 * other two bytes of the "version" data.)
 *
 * So now we use the BF32_SET macros to get consistent behavior (the
 * ondisk LE encoding, since x86 currently rules the world) across
 * platforms, but the "get" behavior requires that we check each of the
 * bytes in the aforementioned former-bitfield for 0x00, and from there,
 * we can know which possible layout we're dealing with. (Only the two
 * that have been observed in the wild are illustrated above, but handlers
 * for all 4 positions of 0x00 are implemented.
