/*
 * Due to frequent changes in the shrinker API the following
 * compatibility wrapper should be used.
 *
 *   shrinker = spl_register_shrinker(name, countfunc, scanfunc, seek_cost);
 *   spl_unregister_shrinker(shrinker);
 *
 * spl_register_shrinker is used to create and register a shrinker with the
 * given name.
 * The countfunc returns the number of free-able objects.
 * The scanfunc returns the number of objects that were freed.
 * The callbacks can return SHRINK_STOP if further calls can't make any more
 * progress.  Note that a return value of SHRINK_EMPTY is currently not
 * supported.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * static unsigned long
 * my_count(struct shrinker *shrink, struct shrink_control *sc)
 * {
 *	...calculate number of objects in the cache...
 *
 *	return (number of objects in the cache);
 * }
 *
 * static unsigned long
 * my_scan(struct shrinker *shrink, struct shrink_control *sc)
 * {
 *	...scan objects in the cache and reclaim them...
 * }
 *
 * static struct shrinker *my_shrinker;
 *
 * void my_init_func(void) {
 *	my_shrinker = spl_register_shrinker("my-shrinker",
 *	    my_count, my_scan, DEFAULT_SEEKS);
 * }
 *
 * void my_fini_func(void) {
 *	spl_unregister_shrinker(my_shrinker);
 * }
