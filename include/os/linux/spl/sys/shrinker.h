/*
 * Due to frequent changes in the shrinker API the following
 * compatibility wrappers should be used.  They are as follows:
 *
 *   SPL_SHRINKER_DECLARE(varname, countfunc, scanfunc, seek_cost);
 *
 * SPL_SHRINKER_DECLARE is used to declare a shrinker with the name varname,
 * which is passed to spl_register_shrinker()/spl_unregister_shrinker().
 * The countfunc returns the number of free-able objects.
 * The scanfunc returns the number of objects that were freed.
 * The callbacks can return SHRINK_STOP if further calls can't make any more
 * progress.  Note that a return value of SHRINK_EMPTY is currently not
 * supported.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * static unsigned long
 * my_count(struct shrinker *shrink, struct shrink_control *sc)
 * {
 *	...calculate number of objects in the cache...
 *
 *	return (number of objects in the cache);
 * }
 *
 * static unsigned long
 * my_scan(struct shrinker *shrink, struct shrink_control *sc)
 * {
 *	...scan objects in the cache and reclaim them...
 * }
 *
 * SPL_SHRINKER_DECLARE(my_shrinker, my_count, my_scan, DEFAULT_SEEKS);
 *
 * void my_init_func(void) {
 *	spl_register_shrinker(&my_shrinker);
 * }
