 * File identifier.  Should be unique per filesystem on a single
 * machine.  This is typically called by a stateless file server
 * in order to generate "file handles".
 *
 * Do not change the definition of struct fid ... fid_t without
 * letting the CacheFS group know about it!  They will have to do at
 * least two things, in the same change that changes this structure:
 *   1. change CFSVERSION in usr/src/uts/common/sys/fs/cachefs_fs.h
 *   2. put the old version # in the canupgrade array
 *      in cachfs_upgrade() in usr/src/cmd/fs.d/cachefs/fsck/fsck.c
 * This is necessary because CacheFS stores FIDs on disk.
 *
 * Many underlying file systems cast a struct fid into other
 * file system dependent structures which may require 4 byte alignment.
 * Because a fid starts with a short it may not be 4 byte aligned, the
 * fid_pad will force the alignment.
