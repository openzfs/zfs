# This is an optional helper script that is automatically called by libzfs
# before a disk is about to be added into the pool.  It can be modified by
# the user to run whatever commands are necessary to prepare a disk for
# inclusion into the pool.  For example, users can add lines to this
# script to do things like update the drive's firmware or check the drive's
# health.  The script is optional and can be removed if it is not needed.
#
# See the zfs_prepare_disk(8) man page for details.
#
# Example:
#
# echo "Prepare disk $VDEV_PATH ($VDEV_UPATH) for $VDEV_PREPARE in $POOL_NAME"
#

exit 0
