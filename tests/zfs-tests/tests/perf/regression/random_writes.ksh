# Description:
# Trigger fio runs using the random_writes job file. The number of runs and
# data collected is determined by the PERF_* variables. See do_fio_run for
# details about these variables.
#
# Prior to each fio run the dataset is recreated, and fio writes new files
# into an otherwise empty pool.
#
# Thread/Concurrency settings:
#    PERF_NTHREADS defines the number of files created in the test filesystem,
#    as well as the number of threads that will simultaneously drive IO to
#    those files.  The settings chosen are from measurements in the
#    PerfAutoESX/ZFSPerfESX Environments, selected at concurrency levels that
#    are at peak throughput but lowest latency.  Higher concurrency introduces
#    queue time latency and would reduce the impact of code-induced performance
#    regressions.
