# DESCRIPTION:
#	Add a swap zvol, and consume most (not all) of the space. This test
#	used to fill up swap, which can hang the system.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create a new zvol and add it as swap
#	2. Fill //var/tmp with 80% the size of the zvol
#	5. Remove the new zvol, and restore original swap devices
#
