# DESCRIPTION:
# Verify 'zfs rename' works on a ZVOL already in use as block device
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create a ZVOL
# 2. Create a filesystem on the ZVOL device and mount it
# 3. Rename the ZVOL dataset
# 4. Receive a send stream with the same name as the old ZVOL dataset and verify
#    we don't trigger any issue like the one reported in #6263
