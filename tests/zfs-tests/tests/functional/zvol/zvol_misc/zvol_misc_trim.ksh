# DESCRIPTION:
#	Verify we can TRIM a zvol
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. TRIM the entire zvol to remove data from older tests
# 2. Create a 5MB data file
# 3. Write the file to the zvol
# 4. Observe 5MB of used space on the zvol
# 5. TRIM the first 1MB and last 2MB of the 5MB block of data.
# 6. Observe 2MB of used space on the zvol
# 7. Verify the trimmed regions are zero'd on the zvol

	# check for it.
