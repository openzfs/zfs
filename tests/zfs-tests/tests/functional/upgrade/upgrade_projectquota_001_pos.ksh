#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
# Check whether zfs upgrade for project quota works or not.
# The project quota is per dataset based feature, this test
# will create multiple datasets and try different upgrade methods.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create a pool with all features disabled
# 2. Create a few dataset for testing
# 3. Make sure automatic upgrade work
# 4. Make sure manual upgrade work
#
