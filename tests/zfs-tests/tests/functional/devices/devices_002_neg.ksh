# DESCRIPTION:
# When set property devices=off on file system, device files cannot be used
# in this file system.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create pool and file system.
# 2. Set devices=off on this file system.
# 3. Separately create block device file and character file.
# 4. Separately read and write from those two device files.
# 5. Check the return value, and make sure it failed.
