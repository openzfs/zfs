# DESCRIPTION:
# There are myriad problems associated with trying to test umountall in a way
# that works reliable across different systems. Some filesystems won't unmount
# because they're busy. Some won't remount because they were legacy mounts in
# the first place. etc...
# Make a best approximation by calling umountall with the -n option, and verify
# that the list of things it would try to unmout makes sense.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Make a list of file systems umountall is known to ignore.
# 2. Append all ZFS file systems on this system.
# 3. Run umountall -n and verify the file systems it reports are in the list.
#

for fs in 1 2 3 ; do
	log_must mounted $TESTPOOL/$TESTFS.$fs

# This is the list we check the output of umountall -n against. We seed it
# with these values because umountall will ignore them, and they're possible
# (though most are improbable) ZFS filesystem mountpoints.
zfs_list="/ /lib /sbin /tmp /usr /var /var/adm /var/run"

# Append our ZFS filesystems to the list, not worrying about duplicates.
