#
# DESCRIPTION:
#       Test mapping of users when using 'zfs allow'.
#
#
# STRATEGY:
#       1. Create datasets for users.
#       2. Delegate permissions to the unprivileged root user.
#       3. Verify 'zfs allow' that inside the namespace shows the correct user.
#       4. Verify that running 'zfs allow' inside a user namespace maps uids.
