# DESCRIPTION:
#	Verify slog replay correctly when TX_REMOVEs are followed by
#	TX_CREATEs.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create a file system (TESTFS) with a lot of files
#	2. Freeze TESTFS
#	3. Remove all files then create a lot of files
#	4. Copy TESTFS to temporary location (TESTDIR/copy)
#	5. Unmount filesystem
#	   <at this stage TESTFS is empty again and unfrozen, and the
#	   intent log contains a complete set of deltas to replay it>
#	6. Remount TESTFS <which replays the intent log>
#	7. Compare TESTFS against the TESTDIR/copy
#

# 1. Create a file system (TESTFS) with a lot of files
#
log_must zpool create $TESTPOOL $VDEV log mirror $LDEV
log_must zfs set compression=on $TESTPOOL
log_must zfs create $TESTPOOL/$TESTFS

# Prep for the test of TX_REMOVE followed by TX_CREATE

#
# Reimport to reset dnode allocation pointer.
# This is to make sure we will have TX_REMOVE and TX_CREATE on same id
#
log_must zpool export $TESTPOOL
log_must zpool import -f -d $VDIR $TESTPOOL

#
# This dd command works around an issue where ZIL records aren't created
# after freezing the pool unless a ZIL header already exists. Create a file
# synchronously to force ZFS to write one out.
#
log_must dd if=/dev/zero of=/$TESTPOOL/$TESTFS/sync \

#
# 2. Freeze TESTFS
#
log_must zpool freeze $TESTPOOL

#
# 3. Remove all files then create a lot of files
#
# TX_REMOVE followed by TX_CREATE

#
# 4. Copy TESTFS to temporary location (TESTDIR/copy)
#
log_must mkdir -p $TESTDIR/copy
log_must cp -a /$TESTPOOL/$TESTFS/* $TESTDIR/copy/

#
# 5. Unmount filesystem and export the pool
#
# At this stage TESTFS is empty again and frozen, the intent log contains
# a complete set of deltas to replay.
#
log_must zfs unmount /$TESTPOOL/$TESTFS

log_note "Verify transactions to replay:"
log_must zdb -iv $TESTPOOL/$TESTFS

log_must zpool export $TESTPOOL

#
# 6. Remount TESTFS <which replays the intent log>
#
# Import the pool to unfreeze it and claim log blocks.  It has to be
# `zpool import -f` because we can't write a frozen pool's labels!
#
log_must zpool import -f -d $VDIR $TESTPOOL

#
# 7. Compare TESTFS against the TESTDIR/copy
#
