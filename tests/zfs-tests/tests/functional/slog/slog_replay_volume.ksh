# DESCRIPTION:
#	Verify slogs are replayed correctly for a volume.
#
#	The general idea is to build up an intent log from a bunch of
#	diverse user commands without actually committing them to the
#	file system.  Then generate checksums for files and volume,
#	replay the intent log and verify the checksums.
#
#	To enable this automated testing of the intent log some minimal
#	support is required of the file system.  In particular, a
#	"freeze" command is required to flush the in-flight transactions;
#	to stop the actual committing of transactions; and to ensure no
#	deltas are discarded. All deltas past a freeze point are kept
#	for replay and comparison later. Here is the flow:
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create an empty volume (TESTVOL), set sync=always, and format
#	   it with an ext4 filesystem and mount it.
#	2. Freeze TESTVOL.
#	3. Create log records of various types to verify replay.
#	4. Generate checksums for all ext4 files.
#	5. Unmount filesystem and export the pool
#	   <at this stage TESTVOL is empty again and unfrozen, and the
#	   intent log contains a complete set of deltas to replay it>
#	6. Import TESTVOL <which replays the intent log> and mount it.
#	7. Verify the stored checksums
#
