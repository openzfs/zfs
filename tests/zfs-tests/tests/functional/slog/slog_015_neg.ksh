# DESCRIPTION:
#	Concurrent sync writes with log offline/online works.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Configure "zfs_commit_timeout_pct"
#	2. Create pool with a log device.
#	3. Concurrently do the following:
#	   3.1. Perform 8K sync writes
#	   3.2. Perform log offline/online commands
#	4. Loop to test with growing "zfs_commit_timeout_pct" values.

	# kicked off in the background to complete. On failure, we may
	# enter this function without previously waiting for them.
