#
# Description:
# Verify that nopwrite still works for a dataset that becomes a clone via
# promotion.
#
# Strategy:
# 1. Create a clone suitable for nopwrite.
# 2. Disable compression and checksum on the clone, and promote it.
# 3. Overwrite the file in the clone (former origin fs) and verify it
# consumes no additional space.
