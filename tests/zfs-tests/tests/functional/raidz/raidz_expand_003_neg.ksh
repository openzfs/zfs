# DESCRIPTION:
#	'zpool attach poolname raidz ...' should reject device attach if pool
#	is in checkpointed state. If checkpoint creation requested on
#	expanding pool, the request should be rejected.

#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create block device files for the test raidz pool.
#	2. Create pool and checkpoint it.
#	3. Try to expand raidz, ensure that request rejected.
#	4. Recreate the pool.
#	5. Apply raidz expansion.
#	6. Ensure, that checkpoint cannot be created.
