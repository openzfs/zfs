#
# DESCRIPTION:
# Verify that new label works for more advanced pool operations.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create large virtual disks for the new label type
#	2. Create pool using large-label disks
#	3. Verify disks are using the new label format
#	4. Perform more advanced pool operations (import, export, scrub, destroy)
#
