# DESCRIPTION:
#
# setting bootfs on a dataset which has gzip compression enabled will not fail
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. create pools based on a valid vdev
# 2. create a filesystem on this pool and set the compression property to
#    gzip1-9
# 3. set the pool's bootfs property to filesystem we just configured which
#    should not fail
#
