# BACKGROUND:
#
# ztest hit an issue where it ran zdb and zdb failed because
# it couldn't access some indirect mappings at the end of a
# vdev. The issue was that the vdev's ms_shift had changed after
# it was removed by the addition of another vdev. This test is
# a regression test for ensuring this case doesn't come up again.
