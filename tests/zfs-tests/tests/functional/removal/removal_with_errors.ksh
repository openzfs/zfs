#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
# This test ensures the device removal is cancelled when hard IO
# errors are encountered during the removal process.  This is done
# to ensure that when removing a device all of the data is copied.
#
# STRATEGY:
#
# 1. We create a pool with enough redundancy such that IO errors
#    will not result in the pool being suspended.
# 2. We write some test data to the pool.
# 3. We inject READ errors in to one half of the top-level mirror-0
#    vdev which is being removed.  Then we start the removal process.
# 4. Verify that the injected read errors cause the removal of
#    mirror-0 to be cancelled and that mirror-0 has not been removed.
# 5. Clear the read fault injection.
# 6. Repeat steps 3-6 above except inject WRITE errors on one of
#    child vdevs in the destination mirror-1.
# 7. Lastly verify the pool data is still intact.
