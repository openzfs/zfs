#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
# When a pool has an ongoing removal and it is exported ZFS
# suspends the removal thread beforehand. This test ensures
# that ZFS restarts the removal thread if the export fails
# for some reason.
#
# STRATEGY:
#
# 1. Create a pool with one vdev and do some writes on it.
# 2. Add a new vdev to the pool and start the removal of
#    the first vdev.
# 3. Inject a fault in the pool and attempt to export (it
#    should fail).
# 4. After the export fails ensure that the removal thread
#    was restarted and the process complete successfully.
