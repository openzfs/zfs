#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
# This test ensures that even when child vdevs are unavailable the
# device removal process copies from readable source children to
# writable destination children.  This may be different than the
# default mapping which preferentially pairs up source and destination
# child vdevs based on their child ids.
#
# Default Mapping:
#   mirror-0                mirror-1
#     DISK0 (child 0) ------> DISK2 (child 0)
#     DISK1 (child 1) ------> DISK3 (child 1)
#
# We want to setup a scenario where the default mapping would make
# it impossible to copy any data during the removal process.  This
# is done by faulting both the mirror-0 (child 0) source vdev and
# mirror-1 (child 1) destination vdev.  As shown below the default
# mapping cannot be used due to the FAULTED vdevs.  Verify that an
# alternate mapping is selected and all the readable data is copied.
#
# Default Mapping (BAD):
#   mirror-0                mirror-1
#     DISK0 (FAULTED) ------> DISK2
#     DISK1 ----------------> DISK3 (FAULTED)
#
# Required Mapping (GOOD):
#   mirror-0                mirror-1
#     DISK0 (FAULTED)   +---> DISK2
#     DISK1 ------------+     DISK3 (FAULTED)
#
# STRATEGY:
#
# 1. We create a pool with two top-level mirror vdevs.
# 2. We write some test data to the pool.
# 3. We fault two children to force the scenario described above.
# 4. We remove the mirror-0 device.
# 5. We verify that the device has been removed and that all of the
#    data is still intact.
