#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
# For device removal a file's contents should transfer
# completely from one disk to another. That should remain
# to be the case even if multiple levels of indirection
# are introduced as we remove more and more devices.
#
# STRATEGY:
#
# 1. We create a file of size 128k and we save its contents
#    in a local variable.
# 2. We set the limit of the maximum copied segment size of
#    removals to 32k, so during removal our 128k file will
#    be split to 4 blocks.
# 3. We start removing disks and adding them back in a loop.
#    This way the file is moved around and introduces split
#    blocks.
# 4. The loop itself tests that we don't have any problem
#    when removing many devices. Within the loop we test
#    that the files contents remain the same across transfers.
