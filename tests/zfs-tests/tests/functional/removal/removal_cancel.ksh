#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
# Ensure that cancelling a removal midway does not cause any
# issues like cause a panic.
#
# STRATEGY:
#
# 1. Create a pool with one vdev and do some writes on it.
# 2. Add a new vdev to the pool and start the removal of
#    the first vdev.
# 3. Cancel the removal after some segments have been copied
#    over to the new vdev.
# 4. Run zdb to ensure the on-disk state of the pool is ok.
