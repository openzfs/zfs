#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	When the destination file is mmaped and is already cached we need to
#	update mmaped pages after successful clone.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create a pool.
#	2. Create a two test files with random content.
#	3. mmap the files, read them and clone from one to the other using
#	   clone_mmap_cached.
#	4. clone_mmap_cached also verifies if the content of the destination
#	   file was updated while reading it from mmaped memory.
