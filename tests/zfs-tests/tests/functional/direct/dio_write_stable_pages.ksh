# DESCRIPTION:
# 	Verify stable pages work for O_DIRECT writes.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Start a Direct I/O write workload while manipulating the user
#	   buffer.
#	2. Verify we can Read the contents of the file using buffered reads.
#	3. Verify there is no checksum errors reported from zpool status.
#	4. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for 3 iterations.
#	5. Repeat 1-3 but with compression disabled.
