# DESCRIPTION:
#	Verify Direct I/O reads can read an entire file that is not
#	page-aligned in length. When a file is not page-aligned in total
#	length, as much that can be read using using O_DIRECT is done so and
#	the rest is read using the ARC. O_DIRECT requires page-size alignment.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Write a file that is page-aligned (buffered)
#	2. Truncate the file to be 512 bytes less
#	3. Export then import the Zpool flushing out the ARC
#	4. Read back the file using O_DIRECT
#	5. Verify the file is read back with both Direct I/O and buffered I/O
