# DESCRIPTION:
# 	Verify checksum verify works for Direct I/O writes.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Set the module parameter zfs_vdev_direct_write_verify to 0.
#	2. Check that manipulating the user buffer while Direct I/O writes are
#	   taking place does not cause any panics with compression turned on.
#	3. Start a Direct I/O write workload while manipulating the user buffer
#	   without compression.
#	4. Verify there are Direct I/O write verify failures using
#	   zpool status -d and checking for zevents. We also make sure there
#	   are reported data errors when reading the file back.
#	5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for 3 iterations.
#	6. Set zfs_vdev_direct_write_verify set to 1 and repeat 3.
#	7. Verify there are Direct I/O write verify failures using
#	   zpool status -d and checking for zevents. We also make sure there
#	   there are no reported data errors when reading the file back because
#	   with us checking every Direct I/O write and on checksum validation
#	   failure those writes will not be committed to a VDEV.
