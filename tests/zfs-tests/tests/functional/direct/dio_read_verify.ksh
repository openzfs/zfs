# DESCRIPTION:
# 	Verify checksum verify works for Direct I/O reads.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create a zpool from each vdev type.
#	2. Start a Direct I/O read workload while manipulating the user buffer
#	   contents.
#	3. Verify there are Direct I/O read verify failures using
#	   zpool status -d and checking for zevents. We also make sure there
#	   are reported no data errors.
#

# We will verify that there are no checksum errors for every Direct I/O read
# while manipulating the buffer contents while the I/O is still in flight and
# also that Direct I/O checksum verify failures and dio_verify_rd zevents are
# reported.
