# DESCRIPTION:
#	l2arc_mfuonly does not cache MRU buffers
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Set l2arc_mfuonly=yes
#	2. Create pool with a cache device.
#	3. Create a random file in that pool, smaller than the cache device
#		and random read for 10 sec.
#	4. Export and re-import the pool. This is necessary as some MFU ghost
#		buffers with prefetch status may transition to MRU eventually.
#		By re-importing the pool the l2 arcstats reflect the ARC state
#		of L2ARC buffers upon their caching in L2ARC.
#	5. Verify l2arc_mru_asize is 0.
#
