# DESCRIPTION:
# Write a file to the allowable ZFS fs size.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. largest_file will write to a file and increase its size
# to the maximum allowable.
# 2. The last byte of the file should be accessible without error.
# 3. Writing beyond the maximum file size generates an 'errno' of
# EFBIG.
