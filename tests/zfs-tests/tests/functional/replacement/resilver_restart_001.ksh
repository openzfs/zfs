# DESCRIPTION:
# Testing resilver restart logic both with and without the deferred resilver
# feature enabled, verifying that resilver is not restarted when it is
# unnecessary.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create a pool
# 2. Create four filesystems with the primary cache disable to force reads
# 3. Write four files simultaneously, one to each filesystem
# 4. Do with and without deferred resilvers enabled
#    a. Replace a vdev with a spare & suspend resilver immediately
#    b. Verify resilver starts properly
#    c. Offline / online another vdev to introduce a new DTL range
#    d. Verify resilver restart or defer
#    e. Inject read errors on vdev that was offlined / onlned
#    f. Verify that resilver did not restart
#    g. Unsuspend resilver and wait for it to finish
#    h. Verify that there are two resilvers and nothing is deferred
