# DESCRIPTION:
# Testing resilver completes when scan errors are encountered, but relevant
# DTL's have not been lost.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create a pool (1k recordsize)
# 2. Create a 32m file (32k records)
# 3. Inject an error halfway through the file
# 4. Start a resilver, ensure the error is triggered and that the resilver
#    does not restart after finishing
#
# NB: use legacy scanning to ensure scan of specific block causes error
#
