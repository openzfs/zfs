# Description:
# Verify device_rebuild feature flags.
#
# Strategy:
# 1. Create a pool with all features disabled.
# 2. Verify 'zpool replace -s' fails and the feature is disabled.
# 3. Enable the device_rebuild feature.
# 4. Verify 'zpool replace -s' works and the feature is active.
# 5. Wait for the feature to return to enabled.
