#
# Description:
# Verify that attach/detach work while resilvering and attaching
# multiple vdevs.
#
# Strategy:
# 1. Create a single vdev pool
# 2. While healing or sequential resilvering:
#    a. Attach a vdev to convert the pool to a mirror.
#    b. Attach a vdev to convert the pool to a 3-way mirror.
#    c. Verify the original vdev cannot be removed (no redundant copies)
#    d. Detach a vdev.  Healing and sequential resilver remain running.
#    e. Detach a vdev.  Healing resilver remains running, sequential
#       resilver is canceled.
#    f. Wait for resilver to complete.
