# DESCRIPTION:
# Sanity test to make sure checksum algorithms work.
# For each checksum, create a file in the pool using that checksum.  Verify
# that there are no checksum errors.  Next, for each checksum, create a single
# file in the pool using that checksum, corrupt the file, and verify that we
# correctly catch the checksum errors.
#
# STRATEGY:
# Test 1
# 1. Create a mirrored pool
# 2. Create a file using each checksum
# 3. Export/import/scrub the pool
# 4. Verify there's no checksum errors.
# 5. Clear the pool
#
# Test 2
# 6. For each checksum:
# 7.	Create a file using the checksum
# 8.	Corrupt all level 0 blocks in the file
# 9.	Scrub the pool
# 10.	Verify that there are checksum errors
