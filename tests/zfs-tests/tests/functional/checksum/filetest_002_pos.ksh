# DESCRIPTION:
# Sanity test to make sure checksum algorithms work.
# For each checksum, create a file in the pool using that checksum.  Verify
# that there are no checksum errors.  Next, for each checksum, create a single
# file in the pool using that checksum, corrupt the file, and verify that we
# correctly catch the checksum errors.
#
# STRATEGY:
# Test 1
# 1. For each checksum:
# 2.	Create a file using the checksum
# 3.	Corrupt all level 1 blocks in the file
# 4.	Export and import the pool
# 5.	Verify that there are checksum errors
