# DESCRIPTION:
# Test hole-punching functionality
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create a dense file
# 2. Punch an assortment of holes in the file and verify the result.
#
# Note: We can't compare exact block numbers as reported by du, because
# different backing stores may allocate different numbers of blocks for
# the same amount of data.
#

# Prior to __FreeBSD_version 1400032 there are no mechanism to punch hole in a
# file on FreeBSD.  truncate -d support is required to call fspacectl(2) on
# behalf of the script.
