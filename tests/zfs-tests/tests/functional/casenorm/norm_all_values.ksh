# DESCRIPTION:
# Check that we can create FS with all supported normalization forms.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create FS with all supported normalization forms.
# 2. Check that utf8only is set on except for normalization=none.
# 3. Check that it's not possible to create FS with utf8only=off
#    and normalization other than none.
