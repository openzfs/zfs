# DESCRIPTION:
# For the filesystem with casesensitivity=mixed, normalization=formD,
# check that delete succeeds if (case=same).
#
# STRATEGY:
# For each c/n name form:
# 1. Create file with given c/n name form.
# 2. Check that delete succeeds if (case=same).
# 3. Check that file is no longer accessible using any name form.
# 4. Check that delete fails for all other name forms other than original.
