# DESCRIPTION:
#	Scan all permissions one by one to verify privileged user
#	can not use permissions properly when delegation property is set off
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Delegate all the permission one by one to user on dataset.
#	2. Verify privileged user can not use permissions properly when
#	delegation property is off
