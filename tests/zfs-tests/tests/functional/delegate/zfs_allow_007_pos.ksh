# DESCRIPTION:
#	Verify the permissions set will be masked on its descendent
#	datasets by same name set.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create $ROOT_TESTFS/childfs
#	2. Set permission $perms1 to @set on $ROOT_TESTFS
#	3. Reset permission $perms2 to @set on $ROOT_TESTFS/childfs
#	4. Allow @set to $STAFF1 on $ROOT_TESTFS/childfs
#	5. Verify $perms2 is delegated on $ROOT_TESTFS/childfs and its
#	   descendent.
#	6. Allow @set to $STAFF1 on $ROOT_TESTFS
#	7. Verify $perms1 is not appended to $STAFF1 on $ROOT_TESTFS/childfs and
#	   its descendent since it is masked
#
