# DESCRIPTION:
#	Verify option '-c' will be granted locally to the creator on any
#	newly-created descendent file systems.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Allow create permissions to everyone on $ROOT_TESTFS locally.
#	2. Allow '-c' create to $ROOT_TESTFS.
#	3. chmod 777 the mountpoint of $ROOT_TESTFS
#	4. Verify only creator can create descendent dataset on
#	   $ROOT_TESTFS/$user.
