# DESCRIPTION:
# Test that injected decryption errors are handled correctly.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create an encrypted dataset with a test file
# 2. Inject decryption errors on the file 20% of the time
# 3. Read the file to confirm that errors are handled correctly
# 4. Confirm that the decryption injection was added to the ZED logs
#
