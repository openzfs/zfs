# DESCRIPTION:
# Testing Fault Management Agent ZED Logic - Automated Auto-Spare Test when
# drive is faulted due to CHECKSUM ERRORS.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create a pool with hot spares
# 2. Create a filesystem with the primary cache disable to force reads
# 3. Write a file to the pool to be read back
# 4. Inject CHECKSUM ERRORS on read with a zinject error handler
# 5. Verify the ZED kicks in a hot spare and expected pool/device status
# 6. Clear the fault
# 7. Verify the hot spare is available and expected pool/device status
#
