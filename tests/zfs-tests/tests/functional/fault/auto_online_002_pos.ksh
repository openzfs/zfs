# DESCRIPTION:
# Testing Fault Management Agent ZED Logic - Automated Auto-Online Test.
# Now with partitioned vdevs.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Partition a scsi_debug device for simulating removal
# 2. Create a pool
# 3. Offline disk
# 4. ZED polls for an event change for online disk to be automatically
#    added back to the pool.
