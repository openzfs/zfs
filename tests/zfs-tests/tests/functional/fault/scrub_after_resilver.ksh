# DESCRIPTION:
# Test the scrub after resilver zedlet
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create a mirrored pool
# 2. Fault a disk
# 3. Replace the disk, starting a resilver
# 4. Verify that a scrub happens after the resilver finishes
#

log_assert "Testing the scrub after resilver zedlet"

# Backup our zed.rc
zedrc_backup=$(zed_rc_backup)

# Enable ZED_SCRUB_AFTER_RESILVER in zed.rc
zed_rc_set ZED_SCRUB_AFTER_RESILVER 1

function cleanup
{
	# Restore our zed.rc
	log_must zed_rc_restore $zedrc_backup
	default_cleanup_noexit
	log_must zpool labelclear -f $DISK1

# Write to our degraded pool so we have some data to resilver

# Replace the failed disks, forcing a resilver
log_must zpool replace $TESTPOOL $DISK1 $DISK3

# Wait for the resilver to finish, and then the subsequent scrub to finish.
# Waiting for the scrub has the effect of waiting for both.  Timeout after 10
# seconds if nothing is happening.
