# Description:
# Verify that per-vdev ZAPs are properly transferred on attach/detach.
#
# Strategy:
# 1. Create a pool with one disk. Verify that it has a top and leaf ZAP.
# 2. Attach a disk.
# 3. Verify that top-level and leaf-level ZAPs were transferred properly.
# 4. Verify that the newly-attached disk has a leaf ZAP.
# 5. Detach the original disk.
# 6. Verify that top-level and leaf-level ZAPs were transferred properly.
