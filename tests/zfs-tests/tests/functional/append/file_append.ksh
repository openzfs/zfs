#
# DESCRIPTION:
# Tests file offset using O_APPEND.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Open file using O_APPEND
# 2. Write to the file using random number of blocks (1, 2, or 3)
# 3. Verify that the file offset is correct using lseek after the write
# 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3, 5 times
# 5. Close the file.
# 6. Repeat steps 1-5 but also open file with O_DIRECT
#
