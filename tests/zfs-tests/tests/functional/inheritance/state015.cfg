# *** ASSERTION DESCRIPTION ***
#
# Verify that executing 'zfs inherit' at the top level in the hierarchy
# when the middle level properties are set locally, and the bottom
# level has inherited its value from the middle level, results in no change
# to the top level properties.
#
# Executing 'zfs inherit' at the middle level results in the middle level
# inheriting its value from the top level, and passing the values down to
# the bottom level.
#
# Executing 'zfs inherit' at the bottom level is somewhat redundant but
# is done for completeness sake.
