# *** ASSERTION DESCRIPTION ***
#
# Verify that executing 'zfs inherit' at the top level in the hierarchy
# when the top level properties are set locally and the middle and bottom
# datasets have inherited from the top level, results in the top level
# properties reverting back to their default values, the middle and bottom
# levels inheriting the changed values.
#
# Executing 'zfs inherit' at the middle and bottom levels is somewhat
# redundant but is done for completeness sake.
