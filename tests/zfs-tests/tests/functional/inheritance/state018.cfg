# *** ASSERTION DESCRIPTION ***
#
# Verify that executing 'zfs inherit -r' at the top level in the hierarchy
# when the top level and middle level datasets properties are set locally,
# and the bottom level has inherited its properties from the middle
# level, results in the top level properties reverting back to their
# default values and being propagated down to the other datasets in the
# hierarchy.
#
# Executing 'zfs inherit -r' at the middle and bottom levels after executing
# it at the top level is somewhat redundant but is done for completeness sake.
