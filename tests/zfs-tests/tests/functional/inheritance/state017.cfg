# *** ASSERTION DESCRIPTION ***
#
# Verify that executing 'zfs inherit' at the top level in the hierarchy
# when the top level and middle level datasets properties are set locally,
# and the bottom level has inherited its properties from the middle
# level, results in the top level properties reverting back to their
# default values.
#
# Executing 'zfs inherit' at the middle level results in the middle level
# inheriting its value from the top level (which is now default), and passing
# the values down to the bottom level.
#
# Executing 'zfs inherit' at the bottom level is somewhat redundant but
# is done for completeness sake.
