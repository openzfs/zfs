# DESCRIPTION:
#	Verify that 'zfs receive' produces an error when mixing
#	raw and non-raw sends in a way that would break IV set
#	consistency.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create an initial dataset with 3 snapshots.
#	2. Perform a raw send of the first snapshot to 2 other datasets.
#	3. Perform a non-raw send of the second snapshot to one of
#	   the other datasets. Perform a raw send from this dataset to
#	   the last one.
#	4. Attempt to raw send the final snapshot of the first dataset
#	   to the other 2 datasets, which should fail.
#	5. Repeat steps 1-4, but using bookmarks for incremental sends.
#
#
# A                 B             C     notes
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# snap1 ---raw---> snap1 --raw--> snap1 # all snaps initialized via raw send
# snap2 -non-raw-> snap2 --raw--> snap2 # A sends non-raw to B, B sends raw to C
# snap3 ------------raw---------> snap3 # attempt send to C (should fail)
