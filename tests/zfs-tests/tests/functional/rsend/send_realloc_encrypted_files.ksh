# Description:
# Verify encrypted raw incremental receives handle dnode reallocation.

# Strategy:
# 1. Create a pool containing an encrypted filesystem.
# 2. Use 'zfs send -wp' to perform a raw send of the initial filesystem.
# 3. Repeat the following steps N times to verify raw incremental receives.
#   a) Randomly change several key dataset properties.
#   b) Modify the contents of the filesystem such that dnode reallocation
#      is likely during the 'zfs receive', and receive_object() exercises
#      as much of its functionality as possible.
#   c) Create a new snapshot and generate an raw incremental stream.
#   d) Receive the raw incremental stream and verify the received contents.
#   e) Destroy the incremental stream and old snapshot.
