# Description:
# Verify resumability of a full and incremental ZFS send/receive in the
# presence of a corrupted stream.
#
# Strategy:
# 1. Start a full ZFS send, redirect output to a file
# 2. Mess up the contents of the stream state file on disk
# 3. Try ZFS receive, which should fail with a checksum mismatch error
# 4. ZFS send to the stream state file again using the receive_resume_token
# 5. ZFS receive and verify the receive completes successfully
# 6. Repeat steps on an incremental ZFS send
# 7. Repeat the entire procedure for a dataset at the pool root
#
