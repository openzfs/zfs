# DESCRIPTION:
# Verify that zfs properly handles encryption properties when receiving
# send streams.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create a few unencrypted and encrypted test datasets with some data
# 2. Take snapshots of these datasets in preparation for sending
# 3. Verify that 'zfs recv -o keylocation=prompt' fails
# 4. Verify that 'zfs recv -x <encryption prop>' fails on a raw send stream
# 5. Verify that encryption properties cannot be changed on incrementals
# 6. Verify that a simple send can be received as an encryption root
# 7. Verify that an unencrypted props send can be received as an
#    encryption root
# 8. Verify that an unencrypted recursive send can be received as an
#    encryption root
# 9. Verify that an unencrypted props send can be received as an
#    encryption child
# 10. Verify that an unencrypted recursive send can be received as an
#     encryption child
