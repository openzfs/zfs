# Description:
# Verify spill blocks are correctly preserved.
#
# Strategy:
# 1) Create a set of files each containing some file data.
# 2) Add enough xattrs to the file to require a spill block.
# 3) Snapshot and send these files to a new dataset.
# 4) Modify the files and spill blocks in a variety of ways.
# 5) Send the changes using an incremental send stream.
# 6) Verify that all the xattrs (and thus the spill block) were
#    preserved when receiving the incremental stream.
