# DESCRIPTION:
#	zfs receive can handle out of space correctly.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create two pools, one is big and another is small.
#	2. Fill the big pool with data.
#	3. Take snapshot and backup the whole pool.
#	4. Receive this stream in small pool.
#	5. Verify zfs receive can handle the out of space error correctly.
