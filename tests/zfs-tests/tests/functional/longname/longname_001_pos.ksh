#
# DESCRIPTION:
# Verify the support for long filenames.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 0.  On a fresh dataset ensure property "longname" is enabled by default.
# 1.  Disable the longname.
# 2.  Try to create a filename whose length is > 256 bytes. This should fail.
# 3.  Enable "longname" property on the dataset.
# 4.  Try to create files and dirs whose names are > 256 bytes.
# 5.  Ensure that "ls" is able to list the file.
# 6.  Ensure stat(1) is able to stat the file/directory.
# 7.  Try to rename the files and directories
# 8.  Try to delete the files and directories
