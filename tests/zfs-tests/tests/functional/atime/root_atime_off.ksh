#
# DESCRIPTION:
# When atime=off, verify the access time for files is not updated when read.
# It is available to pool, fs snapshot and clone.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create pool, fs.
# 2. Create '$TESTFILE' for fs.
# 3. Create snapshot and clone.
# 4. Setting atime=off on dataset and read '$TESTFILE'.
# 5. Verify the access time is not updated.
#

#
# Create $TESTFILE, snapshot and clone.
# Same as 002 except that atime applies to root dataset (OpenZFS#8675).
