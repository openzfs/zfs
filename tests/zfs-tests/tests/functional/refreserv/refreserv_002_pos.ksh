# DESCRIPTION:
#	Setting full size as refreservation, verify no snapshot can be created.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Setting full size as refreservation on pool
#	2. Verify no snapshot can be created on this pool
#	3. Setting full size as refreservation on filesystem
#	4. Verify no snapshot can be created on it and its subfs
#
