# DESCRIPTION:
#	Verify a snapshot will only be allowed if there is enough free pool
#	space outside of this refreservation.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Setting quota and refreservation
#	2. Verify snapshot can be created, when used =< quota - refreserv
#	3. Verify failed to create snapshot, when used > quota - refreserv
