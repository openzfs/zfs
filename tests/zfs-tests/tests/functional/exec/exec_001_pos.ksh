# DESCRIPTION:
# When set property exec=on on a filesystem, processes can be executed from
# this filesystem.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create pool and file system.
# 2. Copy '$STF_PATH/ls' to the ZFS file system.
# 3. Setting exec=on on this file system.
# 4. Make sure '$STF_PATH/ls' can work in this ZFS file system.
# 5. Make sure mmap which is using the PROT_EXEC calls succeed.
