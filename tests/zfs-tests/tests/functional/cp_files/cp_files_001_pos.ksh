# DESCRIPTION:
# Copy a large number of files between 2 directories
# within a zfs filesystem works without errors.
# This make sure zap upgrading and expanding works.
#
# STRATEGY:
#
# 1. Create NR_FILES files in directory src
# 2. Check the number of files is correct
# 3. Copy files from src to dst in readdir order
# 4. Check the number of files is correct
