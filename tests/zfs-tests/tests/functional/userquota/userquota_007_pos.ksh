# DESCRIPTION:
#
#      userquota/groupquota can be set beyond the fs quota
#      userquota/groupquota can be set at a smaller size than its current usage.
#
# STRATEGY:
#       1. set quota to a fs and set a larger size of userquota and groupquota
#       2. write some data to the fs and set a smaller userquota and groupquota
#
