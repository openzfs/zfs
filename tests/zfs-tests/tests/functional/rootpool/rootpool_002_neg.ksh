# DESCRIPTION:
#
# the zfs rootpool/rootfs can not be destroyed
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1) check if the current system is installed as zfs root
# 2) get the rootpool
# 3) try to destroy the rootpool, which should fail
# 4) try to destroy the rootpool filesystem, which should fail
#

# Collect the currently mounted ZFS filesystems, so that we can repair any
# damage done by the attempted pool destroy. The destroy itself should fail,
# but some filesystems can become unmounted in the process, and aren't
# automatically remounted.
mount -p | awk '{if ($4 == "zfs") print $1}' > $tmpfile

# Remount any filesystems that the destroy attempt unmounted.
