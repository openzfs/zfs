# DESCRIPTION:
#	Verify 'zpool online|offline|replace' while TRIMming.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create a pool on the provided VDEVS to TRIM.
#       2. Create a small file and sync the pool.
#       3. Remove the file and sync the pool.
#	4. Manually TRIM the pool.
#	5. Verify 'zpool online|offline|replace' interrupt the TRIM.
#	6. Verify the manual TRIM completes successfully.
