#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	Verify automatic trim pool data integrity.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create a pool on sparse file vdevs to trim.
#	2. Set autotrim=on to enable asynchronous pool trimming.
#	3. Generate some interesting pool data which can be trimmed.
#	4. Verify trim IOs of the expected type were issued for the pool.
#	5. Verify data integrity of the pool after trim.
#	6. Repeat test for striped, mirrored, and RAIDZ pools.
