# DESCRIPTION:
# Verify that a file system and its dependent are unshared when turn off sharenfs
# property.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create a file system
# 2. Set the sharenfs property on the file system
# 3. Create a snapshot
# 4. Verify that both are shared
# 5. Turn off the sharenfs property
# 6. Verify that both are unshared.

# Main test routine.
#
# Given a mountpoint and file system this routine will attempt
# unshare the mountpoint and then verify a snapshot of the mounpoint
# is also unshared.
