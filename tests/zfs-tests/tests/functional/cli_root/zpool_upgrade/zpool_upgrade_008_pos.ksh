# DESCRIPTION:
#
# zpool upgrade should be able to upgrade pools to a given version using -V
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. For all versions pools that can be upgraded on a given OS version
#    (latest pool version - 1)
# 2. Pick a version that's a random number, greater than the version
#    we're running.
# 3. Attempt to upgrade that pool to the given version
# 4. Check the pool was upgraded correctly.

# We're just using the single disk version of the pool, which should be
# enough to determine if upgrade works correctly. Also set a MAX_VER
# variable, which specifies the highest version that we should expect
# a zpool upgrade operation to succeed from.
