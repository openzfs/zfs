# DESCRIPTION:
#	refquota should be sent-and-received, but it should not interfere with
#	the receipt of intermediate snapshots that may have preceded the
#	final snapshot, where the refquota should hold.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create a filesystem.
#	2. Create two equal-sized large files.
#	3. Snapshot the filesystem.
#	4. Remove one of the two large files.
#	5. Create a refquota larger than one file, but smaller than both.
#	6. Snapshot the filesystem again.
#	7. Send a replication stream of the second snapshot to a new filesystem.
