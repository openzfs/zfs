# DESCRIPTION:
#	'zfs recv -F' to force rollback.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create pool and fs.
#	2. Create some files in fs and take a snapshot1.
#	3. Create another files in fs and take snapshot2.
#	4. Create incremental stream from snapshot1 to snapshot2.
#	5. fs rollback to snapshot1 and modify fs.
#	6. Verify 'zfs recv -F' can force rollback.
