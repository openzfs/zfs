# DESCRIPTION:
# ZFS should receive streams from raw sends.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create an encrypted dataset
# 2. Create a file and get its checksum
# 3. Snapshot the dataset
# 4. Attempt to receive a raw send stream as a child of an unencrypted dataset
# 5. Verify the key is unavailable
# 6. Attempt to load the key and mount the dataset
# 7. Verify the cheksum of the file is the same as the original
# 8. Attempt to receive a raw send stream as a child of an encrypted dataset
# 9. Verify the key is unavailable
# 10. Attempt to load the key and mount the dataset
# 11. Verify the cheksum of the file is the same as the original
