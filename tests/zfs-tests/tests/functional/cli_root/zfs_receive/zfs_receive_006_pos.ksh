# DESCRIPTION:
#	'zfs recv -d <fs>' should create ancestor filesystem if it does not
#   exist and it should not fail if it exists
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create pool and fs.
#	2. Create some files in fs and take snapshots.
#	3. Keep the stream and restore the stream to the pool
#	4. Verify receiving the stream succeeds, and the ancestor filesystem
#	   is created if it did not exist
#	5. Verify receiving the stream still succeeds when ancestor filesystem
#	   exists
#
