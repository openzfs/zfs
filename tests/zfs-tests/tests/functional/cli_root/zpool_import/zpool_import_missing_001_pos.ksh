#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	Once a pool has been exported, and one or more devices are
#	damaged or missing (d/m), import should handle this kind of situation
#	as described:
#		- Regular, report error while any number of devices failing.
#		- Mirror could withstand (N-1) devices failing
#		  before data integrity is compromised
#		- Raidz could withstand one devices failing
#		  before data integrity is compromised
#	Verify those are true.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create test pool upon device files using the various combinations.
#		- Regular pool
#		- Mirror
#		- Raidz
#	2. Create necessary filesystem and test files.
#	3. Export the test pool.
#	4. Remove one or more devices
#	5. Verify 'zpool import' will handle d/m device successfully.
#	   Using the various combinations.
#		- Regular import
#		- Alternate Root Specified
#	   It should succeed with single d/m device upon 'raidz', 'mirror',
#	   'draid' but failed against 'regular' or more d/m devices.
#	6. If import succeed, verify following is true:
#		- The pool shows up under 'zpool list'.
#		- The pool's health should be DEGRADED.
#		- It contains the correct test file
#
