#
# DESCRIPTION:
# A pool that was cleanly exported should be importable from a cachefile
# without force even if the local hostid doesn't match the on-disk hostid.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Set a hostid.
#	2. Create a pool with a cachefile.
#	3. Backup the cachfile.
#	4. Export the pool.
#	5. Change the hostid.
#	6. Verify that importing the pool from the cachefile succeeds
#	   without force.
