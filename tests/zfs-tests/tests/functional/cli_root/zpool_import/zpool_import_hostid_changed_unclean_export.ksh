#
# DESCRIPTION:
# A pool that wasn't cleanly exported should not be importable without force if
# the local hostid doesn't match the on-disk hostid.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Set a hostid.
#	2. Create a pool.
#	3. Simulate the pool being torn down without export:
#	3.1. Copy the underlying device state.
#	3.2. Export the pool.
#	3.3. Restore the device state from the copy.
#	4. Change the hostid.
#	5. Verify that importing the pool fails.
#	6. Verify that importing the pool with force succeeds.
