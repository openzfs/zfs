# DESCRIPTION:
#	Import with missing log device should not remove spare/cache.
#

#	1. Create a pool.
#	2. Add spare, cache and log devices to the pool.
#	3. Export the pool.
#	4. Remove the log device.
#	5. Import the pool with -m flag.
#	6. Verify that spare and cache are still present in the pool.
