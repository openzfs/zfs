#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	Once a pool has been exported, but one or more devices are
#	overlapped with other exported pool, import should handle
#	this kind of situation properly.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Repeat 1-3, create two test pools upon device files separately.
#	   These two pools should have one or more devices are overlapped.
#	   using the various combinations.
#		- Regular pool
#		- Mirror
#		- Raidz
#	2. Create necessary filesystem and test files.
#	3. Export the test pool.
#	4. Verify 'zpool import -d' with these two pools will have results
#	   as described:
#		- Regular, report error while any number of devices failing.
#		- Mirror could withstand (N-1) devices failing
#		  before data integrity is compromised
#		- Raidz could withstand one devices failing
#		  before data integrity is compromised
#
