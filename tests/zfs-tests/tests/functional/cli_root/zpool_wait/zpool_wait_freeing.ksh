#
# DESCRIPTION:
# 'zpool wait' works when waiting for background freeing to complete.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create a pool.
# 2. Modify tunables to make sure freeing is slow enough to observe.
# 3. Create a file system with some data.
# 4. Destroy the file system and call 'zpool wait'.
# 5. Monitor the waiting process to make sure it returns neither too soon nor
#    too late.
# 6. Repeat 3-5, except destroy a snapshot instead of a filesystem.
# 7. Repeat 3-5, except destroy a clone.
