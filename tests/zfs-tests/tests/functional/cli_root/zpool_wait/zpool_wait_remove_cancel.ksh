#
# DESCRIPTION:
# 'zpool wait' works when device removal is canceled.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create a pool with two disks and some data.
# 2. Modify a tunable to make sure removal won't complete while test is running.
# 3. Start removing one of the disks.
# 4. Start 'zpool wait'.
# 5. Sleep for a few seconds and check that the process is actually waiting.
# 6. Cancel the removal of the device.
# 7. Check that the wait process returns reasonably promptly.
