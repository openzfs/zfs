#
# DESCRIPTION:
# 'zpool wait' works when waiting for devices to finish being trimmed
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create a pool.
# 2. Start trimming the vdev in the pool, making sure the rate is slow enough
#    that the trim can be observed.
# 3. Start 'zpool wait'.
# 4. Monitor the waiting process to make sure it returns neither too soon nor
#    too late.
