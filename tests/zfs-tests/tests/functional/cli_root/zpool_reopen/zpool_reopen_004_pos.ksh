#
# DESCRIPTION:
# Test zpool reopen -n while scrub is running.
# Checks if re-plugged device is NOT resilvered.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create a pool
# 2. Remove a disk.
# 3. Write test file to pool.
# 4. Execute scrub.
# 5. "Plug back" disk.
# 6. Reopen a pool with an -n flag.
# 7. Check if resilver was deferred.
# 8. Check if trying to put device to offline fails because of no valid
#    replicas.
#
# NOTES:
#	A 125ms delay is added to make sure that the scrub is running while
#	the reopen is invoked.
