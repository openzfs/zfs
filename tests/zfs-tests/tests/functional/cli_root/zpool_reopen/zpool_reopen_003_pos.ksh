#
# DESCRIPTION:
# Test zpool reopen while scrub is running.
# Checks if re-plugged device is fully resilvered.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create a pool
# 2. Remove a disk.
# 3. Write a test file to the pool and calculate its checksum.
# 4. Execute scrub.
# 5. "Plug back" disk.
# 6. Reopen a pool.
# 7. Check if scrub scan is replaced by resilver.
# 8. Put another device offline and check if the test file checksum is correct.
#
# NOTES:
#	A 250ms delay is added to make sure that the scrub is running while
#	the reopen kicks the resilver.
