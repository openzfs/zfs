#
# DESCRIPTION:
# Test zpool reopen -n while resilver is running.
# Checks if the resilver is restarted.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create a pool
# 2. Remove a disk.
# 3. Write test file to pool.
# 4. "Plug back" disk.
# 5. Reopen a pool and wait until resilvering is started.
# 6. Reopen a pool again with -n flag.
# 7. Wait until resilvering is finished and check if it was restarted.
#
# NOTES:
#	A 25ms delay is added to make sure that the resilver is running while
#	the reopen is invoked.
