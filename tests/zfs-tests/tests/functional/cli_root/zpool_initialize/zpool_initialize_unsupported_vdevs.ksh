# DESCRIPTION:
# Attempting to initialize unsupported vdevs should fail.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create a pool with the following configuration:
#    root
#      mirror
#        vdev0
#        vdev1 (offline)
#      cache
#        vdev2
#      spare
#        vdev3
# 2. Try to initialize vdev1, vdev2, and vdev3. Ensure that all 3 fail.
