#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	Verify scrub, scrub -p, and scrub -s show the right status.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create pool and create a 100MB file in it.
#	2. zpool scrub the pool and verify it's doing a scrub.
#	3. Pause scrub and verify it's paused.
#	4. Try to pause a paused scrub and make sure that fails.
#	5. Resume the paused scrub and verify scrub is again being performed.
#	6. Verify zpool scrub -s succeed when the system is scrubbing.
