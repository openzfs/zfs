# DESCRIPTION:
#	Resilver prevent scrub from starting until the resilver completes
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Setup a mirror pool and filled with data.
#	2. Detach one of devices
#	3. Create a file for the resilver to work on so it takes some time
#	4. Export/import the pool to ensure the cache is dropped
#	5. Verify scrub failed until the resilver completed
#
