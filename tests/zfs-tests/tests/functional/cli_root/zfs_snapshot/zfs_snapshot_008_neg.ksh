#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	'zfs snapshot pool1@snap pool2@snap' should fail since both snapshots
#	are not in the same pool.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create 2 separate zpools, zpool name lengths must be the same.
#	2. Attempt to simultaneously create a snapshot of each pool.
#	3. Verify the snapshot creation failed.
