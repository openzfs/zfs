# DESCRIPTION:
#	Verify that the space used by multiple copies is charged correctly
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create filesystems with copies set as 2,3 respectively;
#	2. Copy specified size data into each filesystem;
#	3. Verify that the space is charged as expected with zfs list, ls -s, df(1m),
#	   du(1) commands;
#
