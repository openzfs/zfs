# DESCRIPTION:
#	When renaming a set of snapshots, if a snapshot already exists with
#	the new name, then none of the snapshots is renamed.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create a snapshot for a set of datasets.
#	2. Create a new snapshot for one of datasets.
#	3. Attempt to "zfs rename -r" with the second snapshot's name.
#	4. Verify none of the snapshots is renamed.
