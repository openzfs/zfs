# DESCRIPTION:
#	A snapshot already exists with the new name, then none of the
#	snapshots is renamed.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create snapshot for a set of datasets.
#	2. Create a new snapshot for one of datasets.
#	3. Using rename -r command with exists snapshot name.
#	4. Verify none of the snapshots is renamed.
