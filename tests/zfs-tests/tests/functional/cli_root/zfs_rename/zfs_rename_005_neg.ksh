# DESCRIPTION:
#       'zfs rename' should fail when the dataset are not within the same pool
#
# STRATEGY:
#       1. Given a file system, snapshot and volume.
#       2. Rename each dataset object to a different pool.
#       3. Verify the operation fails, and only the original name
#	   is displayed by zfs list.
