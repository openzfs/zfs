# DESCRIPTION:
#       'zfs rename' can successfully rename a volume snapshot.
#
# STRATEGY:
#       1. Create a snapshot of volume.
#       2. Rename volume snapshot to a new one.
#	3. Rename volume to a new one.
#       4. Create a clone of the snapshot.
#       5. Verify that the rename operations are successful and zfs list can
#	   list them.
