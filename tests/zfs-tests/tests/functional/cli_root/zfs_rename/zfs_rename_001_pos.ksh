#
# DESCRIPTION:
#       'zfs rename' should successfully rename valid datasets.
#       As a sub-assertion we check to ensure the datasets that can
#       be mounted are mounted.
#
# STRATEGY:
#       1. Given a file system, snapshot and volume.
#       2. Rename each dataset object to a new name.
#       3. Verify that only the new name is displayed by zfs list.
#       4. Verify mountable datasets are mounted.
