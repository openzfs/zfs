#
# Description:
# Once set zpool autoexpand=off, zpool can *NOT* autoexpand by
# Dynamic VDEV Expansion
#
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1) Create three vdevs (loopback, scsi_debug, and file)
# 2) Create pool by using the different devices and set autoexpand=off
# 3) Expand each device as appropriate
# 4) Check that the pool size is not expanded
#
# NOTE: Three different device types are used in this test to verify
# expansion of non-partitioned block devices (loopback), partitioned
# block devices (scsi_debug), and non-disk file vdevs.  ZFS volumes
# are not used in order to avoid a possible lock inversion when
# layering pools on zvols.
