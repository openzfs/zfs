# DESCRIPTION:
# 'zfs create -p -o version=1' should only cause the leaf filesystem to be version=1
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create $newdataset with -p option, verify it is created
# 2. Verify only the leaf filesystem to be version=1, others use the current version
#

ZFS_VERSION=$(zfs upgrade | head -1 | awk '{print $NF}' \
