# DESCRIPTION:
# 'zfs create -p'  should work as expected
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. To create $newdataset with -p option, first make sure the upper level
#    of $newdataset does not exist
# 2. Make sure without -p option, 'zfs create' will fail
# 3. Create $newdataset with -p option, verify it is created
# 4. Run 'zfs create -p $newdataset' again, the exit code should be zero
#    even $newdataset exists
#
