#
# DESCRIPTION:
# Suspending and resuming trimming works.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create a one-disk pool.
# 2. Start trimming and verify that trimming is active.
# 3. Wait 3 seconds, then suspend trimming and verify that the progress
#    reporting says so.
# 4. Wait 3 seconds and ensure trimming progress doesn't advance.
# 5. Restart trimming and verify that the progress doesn't regress.
