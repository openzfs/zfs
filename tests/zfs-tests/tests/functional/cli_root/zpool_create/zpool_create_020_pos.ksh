# DESCRIPTION:
#
# zpool create -R works as expected
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create a -R altroot pool
# 2. Verify the pool is mounted at the correct location
# 3. Verify that cachefile=none for the pool
# 4. Verify that root=<mountpoint> for the pool
# 5. Verify that no reference to the pool is found in /etc/zfs/zpool.cache
