# DESCRIPTION:
#	Create a pool with same devices twice or create two pools with same
#	devices, 'zpool create' should failed.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Loop to create the following three kinds of pools.
#		- Regular pool
#		- Mirror
#		- Raidz
#	2. Create two pools but using the same disks, expect failed.
#	3. Create one pool but using the same disks twice, expect failed.
