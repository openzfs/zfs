# DESCRIPTION:
# Verify 'zpool reguid' can change pool's GUID.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Use zpool get to obtain the initial GUID of a pool.
# 2. Change pool's GUID with zpool reguid.
# 3. Verify the GUID has changed to a random GUID.
#
# 4. Change pool's GUID with zpool reguid -g.
# 5. Verify the GUID has changed to the specified GUID.
#

# set_guid guid [expected_guid]
