# DESCRIPTION:
# Verify 'zpool reguid' does not accept invalid GUIDs.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Call zpool reguid with an invalid GUID.
# 2. Verify that the call fails.
# 3. Verify that the pool GUID did not change.
#
# 4. Call zpool reguid with a GUID that is already in use.
# 5. Verify that the call fails.
