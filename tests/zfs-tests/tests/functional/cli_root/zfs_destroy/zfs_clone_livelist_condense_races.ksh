# DESCRIPTION
# Test race conditions for livelist condensing

# STRATEGY
# These tests exercise code paths that deal with a livelist being
# simultaneously condensed and deactivated (deleted, exported or disabled).
# If a variable is set, the zthr will pause until it is cancelled or waited
# and then a counter variable keeps track of whether or not the code path is
# reached.

# 1. Deletion race: repeatedly overwrite the same file to trigger condense
# and then delete the clone.
# 2. Disable race: Overwrite enough files to trigger condenses and disabling of
# the livelist.
# 3. Export race: repeatedly overwrite the same file to trigger condense and
# then export the pool.
