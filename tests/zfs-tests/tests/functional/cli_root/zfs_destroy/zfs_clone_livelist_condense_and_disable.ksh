# DESCRIPTION
# Verify zfs destroy test for clones with the livelist feature
# enabled.

# STRATEGY
# 1. Clone where livelist is condensed
#	- create clone, write several files, delete those files
#	- check that the number of livelist entries decreases
#	  after the delete
# 2. Clone where livelist is deactivated
#	- create clone, write files. Delete those files and the
#	  file in the filesystem when the snapshot was created
#	  so the clone and snapshot no longer share data
#	- check that the livelist is destroyed
