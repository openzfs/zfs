#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	Verify 'zfs destroy -f' succeeds as root.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create filesystem in the storage pool
#	2. Set mountpoint for the filesystem and make it busy
#	3. Verify that 'zfs destroy' fails to destroy the filesystem
#	4. Verify 'zfs destroy -f' succeeds to destroy the filesystem.
