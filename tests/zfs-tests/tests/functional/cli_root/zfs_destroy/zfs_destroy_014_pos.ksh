# DESCRIPTION:
#	'zfs destroy -R <snapshot>' can destroy all the child
#	 snapshots and preserves all the nested datasets.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create nested datasets in the storage pool.
#	2. Create recursive snapshots for all the nested datasets.
#	3. Verify when snapshots are destroyed recursively, all
#          the nested datasets still exist.
