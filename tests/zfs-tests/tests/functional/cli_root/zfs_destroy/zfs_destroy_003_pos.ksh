#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	Verify 'zfs destroy [-rR]' succeeds as root.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create two datasets in the storage pool
#	2. Create fs,vol,ctr,snapshot and clones of snapshot in the two datasets
#	3. Create clone in the second dataset for the snapshot in the first dataset
#	4. Verify 'zfs destroy -r' fails to destroy dataset with clone outside it
#	5. Verify 'zfs destroy -R' succeeds to destroy dataset with clone outside it
#	6. Verify 'zfs destroy -r' succeeds to destroy dataset without clone outside it.
