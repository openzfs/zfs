# When the condition it is waiting for becomes true, 'zfs wait' should return
# promptly. We want to enforce this, but any check will be racey because it will
# take some small but indeterminate amount of time for the waiting thread to be
# woken up and for the process to exit.
#
# To deal with this, we provide a grace period after the condition becomes true
# during which 'zfs wait' can exit. If it hasn't exited by the time the grace
# period expires we assume something is wrong and fail the test. While there is
# no value that can really be correct, the idea is we choose something large
# enough that it shouldn't cause issues in practice.
