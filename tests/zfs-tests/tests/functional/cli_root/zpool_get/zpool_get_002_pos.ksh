#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
# zpool get all works as expected
#
# STRATEGY:
#
# 1. Using zpool get, retrieve all default values
# 2. Verify that the header is printed
# 3. Verify that we can see all the properties we expect to see
# 4. Verify that the total output contains just those properties + header.
#
# Test for those properties are expected to check whether their
# default values are sane, or whether they can be changed with zpool set.
#
