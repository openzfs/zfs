#
# DESCRIPTION:
# If invoke "zfs unmount [-f]" with a filesystem|mountpoint
# whose mountpoint property is 'legacy' or 'none',
# it will fail with a return code of 1
# and issue an error message.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Make sure that the ZFS filesystem is mounted.
# 2. Apply 'zfs set mountpoint=legacy|none <filesystem>'.
# 3. Unmount the file system using the various combinations.
#	- Without force option. (FAILED)
#	- With force option. (FAILED)
# 4. Unmount the mountpoint using the various combinations.
#	- Without force option. (FAILED)
#	- With force option. (FAILED)
# 5. Verify the above expected results of the filesystem|mountpoint.
