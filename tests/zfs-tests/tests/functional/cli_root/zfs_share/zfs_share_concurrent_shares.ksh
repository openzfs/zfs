#
# DESCRIPTION:
# Verify that 'zfs set sharenfs=on', 'zfs share', and 'zfs unshare' can
# run concurrently. The test creates 50 filesystem and 50 threads.
# Each thread will run through the test strategy in parallel.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Verify that the file system is not shared.
# 2. Enable the 'sharenfs' property
# 3. Invoke 'zfs unshare' and verify filesystem is no longer shared
# 4. Invoke 'zfs share'.
# 4. Verify that the file system is shared.
# 5. Verify that a shared filesystem cannot be shared again.
# 6. Verify that share -a succeeds.
