# DESCRIPTION: Unmounted canmount=noauto export is removed during zfs share -a
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Share a dataset that also has canmount set to noauto
# 2. Capture the zfs exports file when the dataset is mounted + shared
# 3. Simulate a reboot by unmounting the dataset and restoring the exports file
# 4. Verify that 'zfs share -a' removes the export since dataset is not mounted
#
