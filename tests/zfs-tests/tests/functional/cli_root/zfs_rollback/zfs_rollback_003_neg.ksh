# DESCRIPTION:
#	Separately verify 'zfs rollback ''|-f|-r|-rf|-R|-rR will fail in
#	different conditions.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create pool and file system
#	2. Create 'snap' and 'snap1' of this file system.
#	3. Run 'zfs rollback ""|-f <snap>' and it should fail.
#	4. Create 'clone1' based on 'snap1'.
#	5. Run 'zfs rollback -r|-rf <snap>' and it should fail.
