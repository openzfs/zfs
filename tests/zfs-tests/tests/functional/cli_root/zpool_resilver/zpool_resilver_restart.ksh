# DESCRIPTION:
#	"Verify 'zpool resilver' restarts in-progress resilvers"
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Write some data and detach the first drive so it has resilver
#	   work to do
#	2. Repeat the process with a second disk
#	3. Reattach the drives, causing the second drive's resilver to be
#	   deferred
#	4. Manually restart the resilver with all drives
#
