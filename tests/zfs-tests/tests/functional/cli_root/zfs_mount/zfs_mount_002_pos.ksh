# DESCRIPTION:
# Invoking "zfs mount <filesystem>" with a filesystem whose name is not in
# "zfs list", will fail with a return code of 1.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Make sure the NONEXISTFSNAME ZFS filesystem is not in 'zfs list'.
# 2. Invoke 'zfs mount <filesystem>'.
# 3. Verify that mount failed with return code of 1.
