#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	'zfs mount -O' allow the file system to be mounted over an existing
#	mount point, making the underlying file system inaccessible.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create two filesystem fs & fs1, and create two test files for them.
#	2. Unmount fs1 and set mountpoint property is identical to fs.
#	3. Verify 'zfs mount -O' will make the underlying filesystem fs
#	   inaccessible.
#
