# DESCRIPTION:
# Verify that zfs mount should fail when mounting a mounted zfs filesystem or
# the mountpoint is busy.  On Linux the mount should succeed.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Make a zfs filesystem mounted or mountpoint busy
# 2. Use zfs mount to mount the filesystem
# 3. Verify that zfs mount succeeds on Linux and fails for other platforms
#
