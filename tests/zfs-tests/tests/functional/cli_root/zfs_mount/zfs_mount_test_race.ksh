#
# DESCRIPTION:
# Verify parallel mount ordering is consistent.
#
# There was a bug in initial thread dispatching algorithm which put threads
# under race condition which resulted in undefined mount order.  The purpose
# of this test is to verify `zfs unmount -a` succeeds (not `zfs mount -a`
# succeeds, it always does) after `zfs mount -a`, which could fail if threads
# race.  See github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/{8450,8833,8878} for details.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create pools and filesystems.
# 2. Set same mount point for >1 datasets.
# 3. Unmount all datasets.
# 4. Mount all datasets.
# 5. Unmount all datasets (verify this succeeds).

# to the same top level directory, not this specific layout.
# This layout is just an example that can reproduce race,
# and is also the layout reported in #8833.
