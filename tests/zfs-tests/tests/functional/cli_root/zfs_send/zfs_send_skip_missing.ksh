#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	Verify 'zfs send' will avoid sending replication send
#	streams when we're missing snapshots in the dataset
#	hierarchy, unless -s|--skip-missing provided
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create a parent and child fs and then only snapshot the parent
#	2. Verify sending with replication will fail
#	3. Verify sending with skip-missing will print a warning but succeed
#
