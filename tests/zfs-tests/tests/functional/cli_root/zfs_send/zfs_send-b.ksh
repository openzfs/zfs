# DESCRIPTION:
# 'zfs send -b' should works as expected.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create a source dataset and set some properties
# 2. Verify command line options interact with '-b' correctly
# 3. Send the dataset and its properties to a new "backup" destination
# 4. Set some properties on the new "backup" dataset
# 5. Restore the "backup" dataset to a new destination
# 6. Verify only original (received) properties are sent from "backup"
#
