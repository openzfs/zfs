# DESCRIPTION:
# ZFS should perform raw sends of datasets.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create an encrypted dataset
# 2. Snapshot the default dataset and the encrypted dataset
# 3. Attempt a raw send of both datasets
# 4. Attempt a raw send with properties of both datasets
# 5. Attempt a raw replication send of both datasets
# 6. Unmount and unload the encrypted dataset key
# 7. Attempt a raw send of the encrypted dataset
