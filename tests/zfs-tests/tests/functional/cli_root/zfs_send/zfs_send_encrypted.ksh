# DESCRIPTION:
# ZFS should perform unencrypted sends of encrypted datasets, unless the '-p'
# or '-R' options are specified.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create an encrypted dataset
# 6. Create a child encryption root
# 2. Snapshot the dataset
# 3. Attempt a send
# 4. Attempt a send with properties
# 5. Attempt a replication send
# 7. Unmount the parent and unload its key
# 8. Attempt a send of the parent dataset
# 9. Attempt a send of the child encryption root
#
