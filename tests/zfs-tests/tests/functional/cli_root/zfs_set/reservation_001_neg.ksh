# DESCRIPTION:
# Valid reservation values should be positive integers only.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1) Form an array of invalid reservation values (negative and
# incorrectly formed)
# 2) Attempt to set each invalid reservation value in turn on a
# filesystem and volume.
# 3) Verify that attempt fails and the reservation value remains
# unchanged
#
