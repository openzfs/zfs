# DESCRIPTION:
# A reservation of 'none' (which is an alias for 0) should be allowed. This
# test verifies that is true.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create a new file system in the test pool.
# 2. Set the reservation to 'none'.
# 3. Verify the associated reservation is indeed 0.
# 4. Repeat with reservation set to 0.
#

# Use a unique value so earlier test failures will not impact this test.
