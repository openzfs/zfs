# DESCRIPTION:
#	Ensure that we can open the checkpointed state of a pool
#	as read-only.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create pool
#	2. Populate it
#	3. Take checkpoint
#	4. Modify data (include at least one destructive change) 
#	5. Export and import the checkpointed state as readonly
#	6. Verify that we can see the checkpointed state and not
#	   the actual current state.
#	7. Export and import the current state
#	8. Verify that we can see the current state and not the
