#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	Ensure that checkpoint plays well with indirect mappings
#	and blocks.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Import pool that's slightly fragmented
#	2. Introduce indirection by removing and re-adding devices
#	3. Take checkpoint
#	4. Apply a destructive action and do more random writes
#	5. Run zdb on both current and checkpointed data and make
#	   sure that zdb returns with no errors

# Destroy one dataset, modify an existing one and create a
# a new one. Do more random writes in an attempt to raise
# more fragmentation. Then verify both current and checkpointed
