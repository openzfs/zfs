#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	Rewind to checkpoint on a stressed pool. We basically try to
#	fragment the pool before and after taking a checkpoint and
#	see if zdb finds any checksum or other errors that imply that
#	blocks from the checkpoint have been reused.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Import pool that's slightly fragmented
#	2. Take checkpoint
#	3. Apply a destructive action and do more random writes
#	4. Run zdb on both current and checkpointed data and make
#	   sure that zdb returns with no errors
#	5. Rewind to checkpoint
#	6. Run zdb again

# Destroy one dataset, modify an existing one and create a
# a new one. Do more random writes in an attempt to raise
# more fragmentation. Then verify both current and checkpointed
