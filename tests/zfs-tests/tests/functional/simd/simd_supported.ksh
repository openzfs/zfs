# DESCRIPTION:
#       Make sure we have SIMD support, so it will not go away without notice
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Test if we are running on a Linux x86 system with SSE support
#       2. If so, check if the zfs_fletcher_4_impl module parameter contains
#	   a sse implementation
#	3. If not fail the test, otherwise pass it
