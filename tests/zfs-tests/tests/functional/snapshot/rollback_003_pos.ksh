#
# DESCRIPTION:
# Verify that rollbacks succeed when there are nested file systems.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1) Snapshot an empty file system and rollback
# 2) Create a file in the file system
# 3) Rollback the file system to empty
# 4) Create a nested file system with the same name as the file created in (2)
# 5) Verify a rollback succeeds
