#
# DESCRIPTION:
# An archive of a zfs file system and an archive of its snapshot
# is identical even though the original file system has
# changed since the snapshot was taken.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1) Create files in all of the zfs file systems
# 2) Create a tarball of the file system
# 3) Create a snapshot of the dataset
# 4) Remove all the files in the original file system
# 5) Create a tarball of the snapshot
# 6) Extract each tarball and compare directory structures
#
