#
# DESCRIPTION:
# A zfs file system snapshot is identical to
# the originally snapshotted file system, after the file
# system has been changed. Uses 'cksum'.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create a file in the zfs file system
# 2. Checksum the file for later comparison
# 3. Create a snapshot of the dataset
# 4. Append to the original file
# 5. Verify the snapshot and file agree
#
