# DESCRIPTION:
#	verify that creating/destroying snapshots do things clean
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. create a dataset and set a quota with 500m
#	2. create file of size 400m on the dataset
#	3. take a snapshot and destroy it
#	4. then create file to use all spaces in the dataset
#	5. verify removing the first file should succeed
