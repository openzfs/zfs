# DESCRIPTION:
# to the originally snapshot'd file system, after the file
# system has been changed. Uses 'sum -r'.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1) Create a file in the zfs dataset
# 2) Sum the file for later comparison
# 3) Create a snapshot of the dataset
# 4) Append to the original file
# 5) Verify both checksums match
