# DESCRIPTION:
#
# Attempting to read an xattr on a file for which we have no permissions
# should fail.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create a file with an xattr
#	2. Set the file permissions to 000
#	3. Check that we're unable to read the xattr as a non-root user
#	4. Check that we're unable to write an xattr as a non-root user
#
