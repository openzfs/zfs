#
# DESCRIPTION:
# Creating and writing xattrs on files in snapshot directories fails. Also,
# we shouldn't be able to list the xattrs of files in snapshots who didn't have
# xattrs when the snapshot was created (the xattr namespace wouldn't have been
# created yet, and snapshots are read-only) See fsattr(5) for more details.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create a file and add an xattr to it.
#	2. Create another file, but don't add an xattr to it.
#       3. Snapshot the filesystem
#	4. Verify we're unable to alter the xattr on the first file
#	5. Verify we're unable to list the xattrs on the second file
#
