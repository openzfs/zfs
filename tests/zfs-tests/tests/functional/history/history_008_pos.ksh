# DESCRIPTION:
#	Pool history records all recursive operations.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create a filesystem and several sub-filesystems in it.
#	2. Make a recursive snapshot.
#	3. Verify pool history records all the recursive operations.
#	4. Do the same verification for hold, release, inherit, rollback and
#	   destroy.
