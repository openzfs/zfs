#
# DESCRIPTION:
# Make sure errors caused by messages being dropped from the list backing the
# procfs file are handled gracefully.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Make sure a few entries have been logged.
# 2. Open the procfs file and start reading from it.
# 3. Write to the file to cause its contents to be dropped.
# 4. Resume reading from the first instance, and check that the expected
#    error is received.
# 5. Repeat steps 1-4, except instead of dropping all the messages by writing
#    to the file, cause enough new messages to be written that the old messages
#    are dropped.
