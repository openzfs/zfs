# DESCRIPTION:
# Make sure that interleaving reads from different readers does not affect the
# results that are returned.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Make sure a few debug messages have been logged.
# 2. Open the procfs file and start reading from it.
# 3. Open the file again, and read its entire contents.
# 4. Resume reading from the first instance.
# 5. Check that the contents read by the two instances are identical.
