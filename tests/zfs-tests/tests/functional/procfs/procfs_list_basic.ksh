# DESCRIPTION:
# Test that we can read from and write to a file in procfs whose contents is
# backed by a linked list.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Take some snapshots of a filesystem, which will cause some messages to be
#    written to the zfs dbgmsgs.
# 2. Read the dbgmsgs via procfs and verify that the expected messages are
#    present.
# 3. Write to the dbgmsgs file to clear the messages.
# 4. Read the dbgmsgs again, and make sure the messages are no longer present.

# Read the debug message file in small chunks to make sure that the read is
# split up into multiple syscalls. This tests that when a syscall begins we
# correctly pick up in the list of messages where the previous syscall left
# off. The size of the read can affect how many bytes the seq_file code has
# left in its internal buffer, which in turn can affect the relative pos that
# the seq_file code picks up at when the next read starts. Try a few
# different size reads to make sure we can handle each case.
#
# Check that the file has the right contents by grepping for some of the
# messages that we expect to be present.
