# DESCRIPTION:
#	refquota limits the amount of space a dataset can consume, but does
#	not include space used by descendents.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Setting refquota in given filesystem
#	2. Create descendent filesystem
#	3. Verify refquota limits the amount of space a dataset can consume
#	4. Verify the limit does not impact descendents
#
