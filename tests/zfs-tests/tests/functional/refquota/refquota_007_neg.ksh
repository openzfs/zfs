# DESCRIPTION:
#       refquota limits the amount of space a dataset can consume,
#       snapshot rollback should be limited by refquota.
#
# STRATEGY:
#       1. Create a file in a filesystem
#       2. Create a snapshot of the filesystem
#       3. Remove the file
#       4. Set a refquota of size half of the file
#       5. Rollback the filesystem from the snapshot
#       6. Rollback should fail
