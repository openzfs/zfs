# DESCRIPTION:
#	Quotas are enforced using the minimum of the two properties:
#	quota & refquota
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Set value for quota and refquota. Quota less than refquota.
#	2. Creating file which should be limited by quota.
#	3. Switch the value of quota and refquota.
#	4. Verify file should be limited by refquota.
