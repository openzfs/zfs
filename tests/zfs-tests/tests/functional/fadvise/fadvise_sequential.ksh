# DESCRIPTION:
# Test posix_fadvise.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Set primarycache to metadata in order to disable prefetch
# 2. Write some data to file 
# 3. get data_size field from arcstat
# 4. call file_fadvise with POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL
# 5. get data_size field from arcstat again
# 6. latter data_size should be bigger than former one
#

# NOTE: if HAVE_FILE_FADVISE is not defined former data_size
# should less or eaqul to latter one
