# This function creates the test archive for migration.
#
# Usage:
# prepare srcdir cmd
#
# Return value: 0 on success
#		1 on failure
#
# Where:
#	srcdir: is the directory where the testfile is
#	cmd:	is the command to be executed.
#		E.g.
#		tar cf $TESTDIR/tar$$.tar
#

#
# This function executes a passed in command and then determines the chksum
# of the resulting file.  The chksum components are checked against the ones
# passed in to determine if they are equal.  If they are equal, 0 is returned
# otherwise 1 is returned.
#
# Usage:
# migrate destdir oldsuma oldsumb command_to_execute
#
# Return value: 0 on success
#		1 on failure
#
# Where:
#	destdir: is the directory where the command is to be executed on
#	oldsuma: is the first part of the values returned by sum
#	oldsumb: is the second part of the values returned by sum
#	cmd: is the command to be executed;
#		E.g.
#		"tar xf $TESTDIR/tar$$.tar"
