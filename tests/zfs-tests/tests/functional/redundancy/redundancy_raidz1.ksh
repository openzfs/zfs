# DESCRIPTION:
#	A raidz pool can withstand at most 1 device failing or missing.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create N(>2,<5) virtual disk files.
#	2. Create raidz pool based on the virtual disk files.
#	3. Fill the filesystem with directories and files.
#	4. Record all the files and directories checksum information.
#	5. Damaged one of the virtual disk file.
#	6. Verify the data is correct to prove raidz can withstand 1 device is
#	   failing.
