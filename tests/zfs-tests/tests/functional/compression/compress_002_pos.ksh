#
# DESCRIPTION:
# Create two files of exactly the same size. One with compression
# and one without. Ensure the compressed file is smaller.
#
# NOTE: This test uses a dataset rather than a simple file system.
#
# STRATEGY:
# Create a dataset, turn on compression and create files before
# and after the property change. The compressed file should be smaller.
