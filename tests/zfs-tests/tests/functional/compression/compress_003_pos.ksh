# DESCRIPTION:
# With 'compression' or 'compress'  set, changing filesystem blocksize cannot
# cause system panic
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Set 'compression' or "compress" to on
#	2. Set different blocksize with ZFS filesystem
#	3. Use 'mkfile' create single block and multi-block files
#	4. Verify the system continued work
#
