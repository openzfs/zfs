# DESCRIPTION:
#
# zfs allow returns an error when run as a user
#
# STRATEGY:
#
# 1. Verify that trying to show allows works as a user
# 2. Verify that trying to set allows fails as a user
#
#

# check to see if we have zfs allow
zfs 2>&1 | grep "allow" > /dev/null
if (($? != 0)) then
	log_unsupported "ZFS allow not supported on this machine."
fi

log_assert "zfs allow returns an error when run as a user"

log_must zfs allow $TESTPOOL/$TESTFS
log_mustnot zfs allow $(logname) create $TESTPOOL/$TESTFS

# now verify that the above command actually did nothing by
# checking for any allow output. ( if no allows are granted,
# nothing should be output )
OUTPUT=$(zfs allow $TESTPOOL/$TESTFS | grep "Local+Descendent" )
if [ -n "$OUTPUT" ]
then
	log_fail "zfs allow permissions were granted on $TESTPOOL/$TESTFS"
fi

log_pass "zfs allow returns an error when run as a user"
