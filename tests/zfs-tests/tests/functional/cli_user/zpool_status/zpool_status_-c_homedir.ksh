# DESCRIPTION:
#	Verify zpool status command mode (-c) works with scripts in user's
#	home directory.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Change HOME to /var/tmp
#	2. Make a simple script that echoes a key value pair
#	   in /var/tmp/.zpool.d
#	3. Make sure it can be run with -c
#	4. Remove the script we created

# to restore zpool's search path.
