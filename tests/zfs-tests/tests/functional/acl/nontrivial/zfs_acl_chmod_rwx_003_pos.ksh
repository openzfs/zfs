# DESCRIPTION:
#	Verify that the read_data/write_data/execute permission for
#	owner/group/everyone are correct.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Loop root and non-root user.
#	2. Separated verify type@:access:allow|deny to file and directory
#	3. To super user, read and write deny was override.
#	4. According to ACE list and override rule, expect that
#	   read/write/execute file or directory succeed or fail.
