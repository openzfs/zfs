# DESCRIPTION:
#
# Setting a reservation on dataset should have no effect on any other
# dataset at the same level in the hierarchy beyond using up available
# space in the pool.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1) Create a filesystem
# 2) Set a reservation on the filesystem
# 3) Create another filesystem at the same level
# 4) Set a reservation on the second filesystem
# 5) Destroy both the filesystems
# 6) Verify space accounted for correctly
#
