# DESCRIPTION:
#
# A thin provisioned volume can become thick provisioned with 'zfs set
# refreservation=auto'.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1) Create a sparse value.
# 2) Use zfs set refreservation=auto to make it thick provisioned.
# 3) Verify that refreservation is now the size predicted by
# volsize_to_reservation().
