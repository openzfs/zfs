#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
# ZFS allows reservations to be set on filesystems and volumes, provided
# the reservation is less than the space available in the pool.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1) Create a regular and sparse volume
#   (filesystem already created by default_setup)
# 2) Get the space available in the pool
# 3) Set a reservation on the filesystem less than the space available.
# 4) Verify that the 'reservation' property for the filesystem has
#    the correct value.
# 5) Reset the reservation to 'none'
# 6) Repeat steps 2-5 for both volume types
#
