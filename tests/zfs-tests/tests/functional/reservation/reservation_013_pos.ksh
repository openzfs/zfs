#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
# Reservation properties on data objects should be preserved when the
# pool within which they are contained is exported and then re-imported.
#
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1) Create a filesystem as dataset
# 2) Create another filesystem at the same level
# 3) Create a regular volume at the same level
# 4) Create a sparse volume at the same level
# 5) Create a filesystem within the dataset filesystem
# 6) Set reservations on all filesystems
# 7) Export the pool
# 8) Re-import the pool
# 9) Verify that the reservation settings are correct
#
