#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
# Setting a reservation reserves a defined minimum amount of space for
# a dataset, and prevents other datasets using that space. Verify that
# reducing the reservation on a filesystem allows other datasets in
# the pool to use that space.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1) Create multiple filesystems
# 2) Set reservations on all bar one of the filesystems
# 3) Fill up the one non-reserved filesystem
# 4) Reduce one of the reservations and verify can write more
# data into the non-reserved filesystem
#
