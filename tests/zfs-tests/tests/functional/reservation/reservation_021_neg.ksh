# DESCRIPTION:
#
# The use of refreservation=auto on a filesystem does not change the
# refreservation and results in an error.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1) Create a filesystem
# 2) Verify that zfs set refreservation=auto fails without changing
# refreservation from none.
# 3) Set refreservation to a valid value.
# 4) Verify that zfs set refreservation=auto fails without changing
# refreservation from the previous value.
