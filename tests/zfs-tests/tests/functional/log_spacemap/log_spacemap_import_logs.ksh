#
# DESCRIPTION:
# Log spacemaps are generally destroyed at export in order to
# not induce performance overheads at import time. As a result,
# the log spacemap codepaths that read the logs in import times
# are not tested outside of ztest and pools with DEBUG bits doing
# many imports/exports while running the test suite.
#
# This test uses an internal tunable and forces ZFS to keep the
# log spacemaps at export, and then re-imports the pool, thus
# providing explicit testing of those codepaths. It also uses
# another tunable to load all the metaslabs when the pool is
# re-imported so more assertions and verifications will be hit.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create pool.
#	2. Do a couple of writes to generate some data for spacemap logs.
#	3. Set tunable to keep logs after export.
#	4. Export pool and verify that there are logs with zdb.
#	5. Set tunable to load all metaslabs at import.
#	6. Import pool.
#	7. Reset tunables.
