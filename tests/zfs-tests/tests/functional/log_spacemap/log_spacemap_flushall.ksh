#
# DESCRIPTION:

# This tests the on-demand "flush all spacemap logs" feature. This is the same
# process is that triggered at pool export, but instead we trigger it ahead of
# time via `zpool condense`.
#
# This test uses the `log_spacemaps` kstat and `zdb -m` to know how much is
# waiting to be flushed. All we're looking for is that the flushall function
# works, not how much it's doing.

#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create pool.
#	2. Write things, which will add to the spacemap logs.
#	3. Save the counters.
#	4. Request the spacemap logs be flushed.
#	5. Compare counters against previous values.
#
