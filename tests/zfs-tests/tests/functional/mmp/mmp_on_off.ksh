# DESCRIPTION:
#	When multihost=off ensure that leaf vdev uberblocks are not updated.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Set multihost=off (disables mmp)
#	2. Set TXG_TIMEOUT to large value
#	3. Create a zpool
#	4. Find the current "best" uberblock
#	5. Sleep for enough time for uberblocks to change
#	6. Find the current "best" uberblock
#	7. If the uberblock changed, fail
#	8. Set multihost=on
#	9. Sleep for enough time for uberblocks to change
#	10. Find the current "best" uberblock
#	11. If uberblocks didn't change, fail
