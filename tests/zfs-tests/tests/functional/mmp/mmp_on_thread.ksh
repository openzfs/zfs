# DESCRIPTION:
#	Ensure that the MMP thread is writing uberblocks.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Set zfs_txg_timeout to large value
#	2. Create a zpool
#	3. Find the current "best" uberblock
#	4. Sleep for enough time for a potential uberblock update
#	5. Find the current "best" uberblock
#	6. If the uberblock never changed, fail
