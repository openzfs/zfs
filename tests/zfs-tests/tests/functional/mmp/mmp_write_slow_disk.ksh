# DESCRIPTION:
#	Verify that long VDEV probes do not cause MMP checks to suspend pool
#	Note: without PR-15839 fix, this test will suspend the pool.
#
#	A device that is returning unexpected errors will trigger a vdev_probe.
#	When the device additionally has slow response times, the probe can hold
#	the spa config lock as a writer for a long period of time such that the
#	mmp uberblock updates stall when trying to acquire the spa config lock.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create a pool with multiple leaf vdevs
#	2. Enable multihost and multihost_history
#	3. Delay for MMP writes to occur
#	4. Verify that a long VDEV probe didn't cause MMP check to suspend pool
