# DESCRIPTION:
#	zfs_multihost_history should report both writes issued and gaps
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create a 2-vdev pool with mmp enabled
#	2. Delay writes by 2*MMP_INTERVAL_DEFAULT
#	3. Check multihost_history for both issued writes, and for gaps where
#	no write could be issued because all vdevs are busy
#
# During the first MMP_INTERVAL period 2 MMP writes will be issued - one to
# each vdev.  At the third scheduled attempt to write, at time t0+MMP_INTERVAL,
# both vdevs will still have outstanding writes, so a skipped write entry will
# be recorded in the multihost_history.
