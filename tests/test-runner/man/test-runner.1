.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBrun\fR command has three basic modes of operation. With neither the
\fB-c\fR nor the \fB-w\fR option, \fBrun\fR processes the arguments provided on
the command line, adding them to the list for this run. If a specified
\fIpathname\fR is an executable file, it is added as a test. If a specified
\fIpathname\fR is a directory, the behavior depends upon the \fB-g\fR option.
If \fB-g\fR is specified, the directory is treated as a test group. See the
section on "Test Groups" below. Without the \fB-g\fR option, \fBrun\fR simply
descends into the directory looking for executable files. The tests are then
executed, and the results are logged.

With the \fB-w\fR option, \fBrun\fR finds tests in the manner described above.
Rather than executing the tests and logging the results, the test configuration
is stored in a \fIrunfile\fR which can be used in future invocations, or edited
to modify which tests are executed and which options are applied. Options
included on the command line with \fB-w\fR become defaults in the
\fIrunfile\fR.

With the \fB-c\fR option, \fBrun\fR parses a \fIrunfile\fR, which can specify a
series of tests and test groups to be executed. The tests are then executed,
and the results are logged.
.sp
.SS "Test Groups"
.sp
.LP
A test group is comprised of a set of executable files, all of which exist in
one directory. The options specified on the command line or in a \fIrunfile\fR
apply to individual tests in the group. The exception is options pertaining to
pre and post scripts, which act on all tests as a group. Rather than running
before and after each test, these scripts are run only once each at the start
and end of the test group.
.SS "Test Execution"
.sp
.LP
The specified tests run serially, and are typically assigned results according
to exit values. Tests that exit zero and non-zero are marked "PASS" and "FAIL"
respectively. When a pre script fails for a test group, only the post script is
executed, and the remaining tests are marked "SKIPPED." Any test that exceeds
its \fItimeout\fR is terminated, and marked "KILLED."

By default, tests are executed with the credentials of the \fBrun\fR script.
Executing tests with other credentials is done via \fBsudo\fR(1m), which must
be configured to allow execution without prompting for a password. Environment
variables from the calling shell are available to individual tests. During test
execution, the working directory is changed to \fIoutputdir\fR.
.SS "Output Logging"
.sp
.LP
By default, \fBrun\fR will print one line on standard output at the conclusion
of each test indicating the test name, result and elapsed time. Additionally,
for each invocation of \fBrun\fR, a directory is created using the ISO 8601
date format. Within this directory is a file named \fIlog\fR containing all the
test output with timestamps, and a directory for each test. Within the test
directories, there is one file each for standard output, standard error and
merged output. The default location for the \fIoutputdir\fR is
\fI/var/tmp/test_results\fR.
.SS "Runfiles"
.sp
.LP
The \fIrunfile\fR is an ini style configuration file that describes a test run.
The file has one section named "DEFAULT," which contains configuration option
names and their values in "name = value" format. The values in this section
apply to all the subsequent sections, unless they are also specified there, in
which case the default is overridden. The remaining section names are the
absolute pathnames of files and directories, describing tests and test groups
respectively. The legal option names are:
