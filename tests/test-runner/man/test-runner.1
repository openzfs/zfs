.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
command has three basic modes of operation.
With neither
.Fl c
nor
.Fl w ,
.Nm
processes the arguments provided on
the command line, adding them to the list for this run.
If a specified
.Ar pathname
is an executable file, it is added as a test.
If a specified
.Ar pathname
is a directory, the behavior depends upon the presence of
.Fl g .
If
.Fl g
is specified, the directory is treated as a test group.
See the section on
.Sy Test Groups
below.
Without
.Fl g ,
.Nm
simply descends into the directory looking for executable files.
The tests are then executed, and the results are logged.
.Pp
With
.Fl w ,
.Nm
finds tests in the manner described above.
Rather than executing the tests and logging the results, the test configuration
is stored in a
.Ar runfile ,
which can be used in future invocations, or edited
to modify which tests are executed and which options are applied.
Options included on the command line with
.Fl w
become defaults in the
.Ar runfile .
.Pp
With
.Fl c ,
.Nm
parses a
.Ar runfile ,
which can specify a series of tests and test groups to be executed.
The tests are then executed, and the results are logged.
.
.Ss Test Groups
A test group is comprised of a set of executable files, all of which exist in
one directory.
The options specified on the command line or in a
.Ar runfile
apply to individual tests in the group.
The exception is options pertaining to pre and post scripts, which act on all tests as a group.
Rather than running before and after each test,
these scripts are run only once each at the start and end of the test group.
.Ss Test Execution
The specified tests run serially, and are typically assigned results according
to exit values.
Tests that exit zero and non-zero are marked
.Sy PASS
and
.Sy FAIL ,
respectively.
When a pre script fails for a test group, only the post script is executed,
and the remaining tests are marked
.Sy SKIPPED .
Any test that exceeds
its
.Ar timeout
is terminated, and marked
.Sy KILLED .
.Pp
By default, tests are executed with the credentials of the
.Nm
script.
Executing tests with other credentials is done via
.Xr sudo 1m ,
which must
be configured to allow execution without prompting for a password.
Environment variables from the calling shell are available to individual tests.
During test execution, the working directory is changed to
.Ar outputdir .
.
.Ss Output Logging
By default,
.Nm
will print one line on standard output at the conclusion
of each test indicating the test name, result and elapsed time.
Additionally, for each invocation of
.Nm ,
a directory is created using the ISO 8601 date format.
Within this directory is a file named
.Sy log
containing all the
test output with timestamps, and a directory for each test.
Within the test directories, there is one file each for standard output,
standard error and merged output.
The default location for the
.Ar outputdir
is
.Pa /var/tmp/test_results .
.Ss "Runfiles"
The
.Ar runfile
is an INI-style configuration file that describes a test run.
The file has one section named
.Sy DEFAULT ,
which contains configuration option
names and their values in
.Sy name No = Ar value
format.
The values in this section apply to all the subsequent sections,
unless they are also specified there, in which case the default is overridden.
The remaining section names are the absolute pathnames of files and directories,
describing tests and test groups respectively.
The legal option names are:
.Bl -tag -width "tests = ['filename', …]"
.It Sy outputdir No = Ar pathname
The name of the directory that holds test logs.
.It Sy pre No = Ar script
Run
.Ar script
prior to the test or test group.
.It Sy pre_user No = Ar username
Execute the pre script as
.Ar username .
.It Sy post No = Ar script
Run
.Ar script
after the test or test group.
.It Sy post_user No = Ar username
Execute the post script as
.Ar username .
.It Sy quiet No = Sy True Ns | Ns Sy False
If
.Sy True ,
only the results summary is printed to standard out.
.It Sy tests No = [ Ns Ar 'filename' , No … ]
Specify a list of
.Ar filenames
for this test group.
Only the basename of the absolute path is required.
This option is only valid for test groups, and each
.Ar filename
must be single quoted.
.It Sy timeout No = Ar n
A timeout value of
.Ar n
seconds.
.It Sy user No = Ar username
Execute the test or test group as
.Ar username .
.El
.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width "-o outputdir"
.It Fl c Ar runfile
Specify a
.Ar runfile
to be consumed by the run command.
.It Fl d
Dry run mode.
Execute no tests, but print a description of each test that would have been run.
.It Fl g
Create test groups from any directories found while searching for tests.
.It Fl o Ar outputdir
Specify the directory in which to write test results.
.It Fl p Ar script
Run
.Ar script
prior to any test or test group.
.It Fl P Ar script
Run
.Ar script
after any test or test group.
.It Fl q
Print only the results summary to the standard output.
.It Fl s Ar script
Run
.Ar script
as a failsafe after any test is killed.
.It Fl S Ar username
Execute the failsafe script as
.Ar username .
.It Fl t Ar n
Specify a timeout value of
.Ar n
seconds per test.
.It Fl u Ar username
Execute tests or test groups as
.Ar username .
.It Fl w Ar runfile
Specify the name of the
.Ar runfile
to create.
.It Fl x Ar username
Execute the pre script as
.Ar username .
.It Fl X Ar username
Execute the post script as
.Ar username .

.Sh EXAMPLES

.It Sy Example 1 : No Running ad-hoc tests.
This example demonstrates the simplest invocation of
.Nm .
