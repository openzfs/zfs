#
# Common generic reasons for a test or test group to be skipped.
#
# Some test cases are known to fail in ways which are not harmful or dangerous.
# In these cases simply mark the test as a known failure until it can be
# updated and the issue resolved.  Note that it's preferable to open a unique
# issue on the GitHub issue tracker for each test case failure.
#
known_reason = 'Known issue'

#
# Some tests require that a test user be able to execute the zfs utilities.
# This may not be possible when testing in-tree due to the default permissions
# on the user's home directory.  When testing this can be resolved by granting
# group read access.
#
# chmod 0750 $HOME
#
exec_reason = 'Test user execute permissions required for utilities'

#
# Some tests require a minimum python version of 3.5 and will be skipped when
# the default system version is too old.  There may also be tests which require
# additional python modules be installed, for example python-cffi is required
# by the pyzfs tests.
#
python_reason = 'Python v3.5 or newer required'
python_deps_reason = 'Python modules missing: python-cffi'

#
# Some tests require the O_TMPFILE flag which was first introduced in the
# 3.11 kernel.
#
tmpfile_reason = 'Kernel O_TMPFILE support required'

#
# Some tests require that the NFS client and server utilities be installed.
#
share_reason = 'NFS client and server utilities required'

#
# Some tests require that the lsattr utility support the project id feature.
#
project_id_reason = 'lsattr with set/show project ID required'

#
# Some tests require that the kernel support user namespaces.
#
user_ns_reason = 'Kernel user namespace support required'

#
# Some rewind tests can fail since nothing guarantees that old MOS blocks
# are not overwritten.  Snapshots protect datasets and data files but not
# the MOS.  Reasonable efforts are made in the test case to increase the
# odds that some txgs will have their MOS data left untouched, but it is
# never a sure thing.
#
rewind_reason = 'Arbitrary pool rewind is not guaranteed'

#
# Some tests may by structured in a way that relies on exact knowledge
# of how much free space in available in a pool.  These tests cannot be
# made completely reliable because the internal details of how free space
# is managed are not exposed to user space.
#
enospc_reason = 'Exact free space reporting is not guaranteed'

#
# Some tests require a minimum version of the fio benchmark utility.
# Older distributions such as CentOS 6.x only provide fio-2.0.13.
#
fio_reason = 'Fio v2.3 or newer required'

#
# Some tests require that the DISKS provided support the discard operation.
# Normally this is not an issue because loop back devices are used for DISKS
# and they support discard (TRIM/UNMAP).
#
trim_reason = 'DISKS must support discard (TRIM/UNMAP)'

#
# Some tests are not applicable to a platform or need to be updated to operate
# in the manor required by the platform.  Any tests which are skipped for this
# reason will be suppressed in the final analysis output.
#
