The majority of the code in the ZFS on Linux port comes from OpenSolaris
which has been released under the terms of the CDDL open source license.
This includes the core ZFS code, libavl, libnvpair, libefi, libunicode,
and libutil.  The original OpenSolaris source can be downloaded from:

http://dlc.sun.com/osol/on/downloads/b121/on-src.tar.bz2

Files which do not originate from OpenSolaris are noted in the file header
and attributed properly.  These exceptions include, but are not limited
to, the vdev_disk.c and zvol.c implementation which are licensed under
the CDDL.

The zpios test code is originally derived from the Lustre pios test code
which is licensed under the GPLv2.  As such the heavily modified zpios
kernel test code also remains licensed under the GPLv2.

The latest stable and development versions of this port can be downloaded
