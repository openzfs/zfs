# Turn off disk's enclosure slot if it becomes FAULTED.
#
# Bad SCSI disks can often "disappear and reappear" causing all sorts of chaos
# as they flip between FAULTED and ONLINE.  If
# ZED_POWER_OFF_ENCLOUSRE_SLOT_ON_FAULT is set in zed.rc, and the disk gets
# FAULTED, then power down the slot via sysfs:
#
# /sys/class/enclosure/<enclosure>/<slot>/power_status
#
# We assume the user will be responsible for turning the slot back on again.
#
# Note that this script requires that your enclosure be supported by the
# Linux SCSI Enclosure services (SES) driver.  The script will do nothing
# if you have no enclosure, or if your enclosure isn't supported.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0: slot successfully powered off
#   1: enclosure not available
#   2: ZED_POWER_OFF_ENCLOUSRE_SLOT_ON_FAULT disabled
#   3: vdev was not FAULTED
#   4: The enclosure sysfs path passed from ZFS does not exist
#   5: Enclosure slot didn't actually turn off after we told it to
