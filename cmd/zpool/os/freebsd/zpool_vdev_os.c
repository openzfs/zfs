/*
 * Functions to convert between a list of vdevs and an nvlist representing the
 * configuration.  Each entry in the list can be one of:
 *
 * 	Device vdevs
 * 		disk=(path=..., devid=...)
 * 		file=(path=...)
 *
 * 	Group vdevs
 * 		raidz[1|2]=(...)
 * 		mirror=(...)
 *
 * 	Hot spares
 *
 * While the underlying implementation supports it, group vdevs cannot contain
 * other group vdevs.  All userland verification of devices is contained within
 * this file.  If successful, the nvlist returned can be passed directly to the
 * kernel; we've done as much verification as possible in userland.
 *
 * Hot spares are a special case, and passed down as an array of disk vdevs, at
 * the same level as the root of the vdev tree.
 *
 * The only function exported by this file is 'make_root_vdev'.  The
 * function performs several passes:
 *
 * 	1. Construct the vdev specification.  Performs syntax validation and
 *         makes sure each device is valid.
 * 	2. Check for devices in use.  Using libdiskmgt, makes sure that no
 *         devices are also in use.  Some can be overridden using the 'force'
 *         flag, others cannot.
 * 	3. Check for replication errors if the 'force' flag is not specified.
 *         validates that the replication level is consistent across the
 *         entire pool.
 * 	4. Call libzfs to label any whole disks with an EFI label.
