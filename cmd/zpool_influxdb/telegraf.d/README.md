This directory contains sample telegraf configurations for
adding `zpool_influxdb` as an input plugin. Depending on your
telegraf configuration, the installation can be as simple as
copying one of these to the `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.d` directory
and restarting `systemctl restart telegraf`

See the telegraf docs for more information on input plugins.
