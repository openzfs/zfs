.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBzfs\fR command configures \fBZFS\fR datasets within a \fBZFS\fR storage pool, as described in \fBzpool\fR(8). A dataset is identified by a unique path within the \fBZFS\fR namespace. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
pool/{filesystem,volume,snapshot}
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
where the maximum length of a dataset name is \fBMAXNAMELEN\fR (256 bytes).
.sp
.LP
A dataset can be one of the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIfile system\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A \fBZFS\fR dataset of type \fBfilesystem\fR can be mounted within the standard system namespace and behaves like other file systems. While \fBZFS\fR file systems are designed to be \fBPOSIX\fR compliant, known issues exist that prevent compliance in some cases. Applications that depend on standards conformance might fail due to nonstandard behavior when checking file system free space.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIvolume\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A logical volume exported as a raw or block device. This type of dataset should only be used under special circumstances. File systems are typically used in most environments.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIsnapshot\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A read-only version of a file system or volume at a given point in time. It is specified as \fIfilesystem@name\fR or \fIvolume@name\fR.
.RE

.SS "ZFS File System Hierarchy"
.sp
.LP
A \fBZFS\fR storage pool is a logical collection of devices that provide space for datasets. A storage pool is also the root of the \fBZFS\fR file system hierarchy.
.sp
.LP
The root of the pool can be accessed as a file system, such as mounting and unmounting, taking snapshots, and setting properties. The physical storage characteristics, however, are managed by the \fBzpool\fR(8) command.
.sp
.LP
See \fBzpool\fR(8) for more information on creating and administering pools.
.SS "Snapshots"
.sp
.LP
A snapshot is a read-only copy of a file system or volume. Snapshots can be created extremely quickly, and initially consume no additional space within the pool. As data within the active dataset changes, the snapshot consumes more data than would otherwise be shared with the active dataset.
.sp
.LP
Snapshots can have arbitrary names. Snapshots of volumes can be cloned or rolled back, but cannot be accessed independently.
.sp
.LP
File system snapshots can be accessed under the \fB\&.zfs/snapshot\fR directory in the root of the file system. Snapshots are automatically mounted on demand and may be unmounted at regular intervals. The visibility of the \fB\&.zfs\fR directory can be controlled by the \fBsnapdir\fR property.
.SS "Clones"
.sp
.LP
A clone is a writable volume or file system whose initial contents are the same as another dataset. As with snapshots, creating a clone is nearly instantaneous, and initially consumes no additional space.
.sp
.LP
Clones can only be created from a snapshot. When a snapshot is cloned, it creates an implicit dependency between the parent and child. Even though the clone is created somewhere else in the dataset hierarchy, the original snapshot cannot be destroyed as long as a clone exists. The \fBorigin\fR property exposes this dependency, and the \fBdestroy\fR command lists any such dependencies, if they exist.
.sp
.LP
The clone parent-child dependency relationship can be reversed by using the \fBpromote\fR subcommand. This causes the "origin" file system to become a clone of the specified file system, which makes it possible to destroy the file system that the clone was created from.
.SS "Mount Points"
.sp
.LP
Creating a \fBZFS\fR file system is a simple operation, so the number of file systems per system is likely to be numerous. To cope with this, \fBZFS\fR automatically manages mounting and unmounting file systems without the need to edit the \fB/etc/fstab\fR file. All automatically managed file systems are mounted by \fBZFS\fR at boot time.
.sp
.LP
By default, file systems are mounted under \fB/\fIpath\fR\fR, where \fIpath\fR is the name of the file system in the \fBZFS\fR namespace. Directories are created and destroyed as needed.
.sp
.LP
A file system can also have a mount point set in the \fBmountpoint\fR property. This directory is created as needed, and \fBZFS\fR automatically mounts the file system when the \fBzfs mount -a\fR command is invoked (without editing \fB/etc/fstab\fR). The \fBmountpoint\fR property can be inherited, so if \fBpool/home\fR has a mount point of \fB/export/stuff\fR, then \fBpool/home/user\fR automatically inherits a mount point of \fB/export/stuff/user\fR.
.sp
.LP
A file system \fBmountpoint\fR property of \fBnone\fR prevents the file system from being mounted.
.sp
.LP
If needed, \fBZFS\fR file systems can also be managed with traditional tools (\fBmount\fR, \fBumount\fR, \fB/etc/fstab\fR). If a file system's mount point is set to \fBlegacy\fR, \fBZFS\fR makes no attempt to manage the file system, and the administrator is responsible for mounting and unmounting the file system.
.SS "Deduplication"
.sp
.LP
Deduplication is the process for removing redundant data at the block-level, reducing the total amount of data stored. If a file system has the \fBdedup\fR property enabled, duplicate data blocks are removed synchronously.  The result is that only unique data is stored and common components are shared among files.
.SS "Native Properties"
.sp
.LP
Properties are divided into two types, native properties and user-defined (or "user") properties. Native properties either export internal statistics or control \fBZFS\fR behavior. In addition, native properties are either editable or read-only. User properties have no effect on \fBZFS\fR behavior, but you can use them to annotate datasets in a way that is meaningful in your environment. For more information about user properties, see the "User Properties" section, below.
.sp
.LP
Every dataset has a set of properties that export statistics about the dataset as well as control various behaviors. Properties are inherited from the parent unless overridden by the child. Some properties apply only to certain types of datasets (file systems, volumes, or snapshots).
.sp
.LP
The values of numeric properties can be specified using human-readable suffixes (for example, \fBk\fR, \fBKB\fR, \fBM\fR, \fBGb\fR, and so forth, up to \fBZ\fR for zettabyte). The following are all valid (and equal) specifications: 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
1536M, 1.5g, 1.50GB
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The values of non-numeric properties are case sensitive and must be lowercase, except for \fBmountpoint\fR, \fBsharenfs\fR, and \fBsharesmb\fR.
.sp
.LP
The following native properties consist of read-only statistics about the dataset. These properties can be neither set, nor inherited. Native properties apply to all dataset types unless otherwise noted.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBavailable\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The amount of space available to the dataset and all its children, assuming that there is no other activity in the pool. Because space is shared within a pool, availability can be limited by any number of factors, including physical pool size, quotas, reservations, or other datasets within the pool.
.sp
This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, \fBavail\fR.

For non-snapshots, the compression ratio achieved for the \fBused\fR space of this dataset, expressed as a multiplier.  The \fBused\fR property includes descendant datasets, and, for clones, does not include the space shared with the origin snapshot.  For snapshots, the \fBcompressratio\fR is the same as the \fBrefcompressratio\fR property.  Compression can be turned on by running: \fBzfs set compression=on \fIdataset\fR\fR. The default value is \fBoff\fR.

\fB\fBused\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The amount of space consumed by this dataset and all its descendents. This is the value that is checked against this dataset's quota and reservation. The space used does not include this dataset's reservation, but does take into account the reservations of any descendent datasets. The amount of space that a dataset consumes from its parent, as well as the amount of space that are freed if this dataset is recursively destroyed, is the greater of its space used and its reservation.
.sp
When snapshots (see the "Snapshots" section) are created, their space is initially shared between the snapshot and the file system, and possibly with previous snapshots. As the file system changes, space that was previously shared becomes unique to the snapshot, and counted in the snapshot's space used. Additionally, deleting snapshots can increase the amount of space unique to (and used by) other snapshots.
.sp
The amount of space used, available, or referenced does not take into account pending changes. Pending changes are generally accounted for within a few seconds. Committing a change to a disk using \fBfsync\fR(2) or \fBO_SYNC\fR does not necessarily guarantee that the space usage information is updated immediately.

Controls how \fBACL\fR entries are inherited when files and directories are created. A file system with an \fBaclinherit\fR property of \fBdiscard\fR does not inherit any \fBACL\fR entries. A file system with an \fBaclinherit\fR property value of \fBnoallow\fR only inherits inheritable \fBACL\fR entries that specify "deny" permissions. The property value \fBrestricted\fR (the default) removes the \fBwrite_acl\fR and \fBwrite_owner\fR permissions when the \fBACL\fR entry is inherited. A file system with an \fBaclinherit\fR property value of \fBpassthrough\fR inherits all inheritable \fBACL\fR entries without any modifications made to the \fBACL\fR entries when they are inherited. A file system with an \fBaclinherit\fR property value of \fBpassthrough-x\fR has the same meaning as \fBpassthrough\fR, except that the \fBowner@\fR, \fBgroup@\fR, and \fBeveryone@\fR \fBACE\fRs inherit the execute permission only if the file creation mode also requests the execute bit.
.sp
When the property value is set to \fBpassthrough\fR, files are created with a mode determined by the inheritable \fBACE\fRs. If no inheritable \fBACE\fRs exist that affect the mode, then the mode is set in accordance to the requested mode from the application.

An \fBaclmode\fR property of \fBgroupmask\fR (the default) reduces user or group permissions. The permissions are reduced, such that they are no greater than the group permission bits, unless it is a user entry that has the same \fBUID\fR as the owner of the file or directory. In this case, the \fBACL\fR permissions are reduced so that they are no greater than owner permission bits.

The \fBgzip\fR compression algorithm uses the same compression as the \fBgzip\fR(1) command. You can specify the \fBgzip\fR level by using the value \fBgzip-\fR\fIN\fR where \fIN\fR is an integer from 1 (fastest) to 9 (best compression ratio). Currently, \fBgzip\fR is equivalent to \fBgzip-6\fR (which is also the default for \fBgzip\fR(1)).

The \fBlz4\fR compression algorithm is a high-performance replacement

The \fBmlslabel\fR property is a sensitivity label that determines if a dataset  can be mounted in a zone on a system with Trusted Extensions enabled. If the labeled dataset matches the labeled zone, the dataset can be mounted  and accessed from the labeled zone.

When the \fBmlslabel\fR property is not set, the default value is \fBnone\fR. Setting the  \fBmlslabel\fR property to \fBnone\fR is equivalent to removing the property.

The \fBmlslabel\fR property can be modified only when Trusted Extensions is enabled and only with appropriate privilege. Rights to modify it cannot be delegated. When changing a label to a higher label or setting the initial dataset label, the \fB{PRIV_FILE_UPGRADE_SL}\fR privilege is required. When changing a label to a lower label or the default (\fBnone\fR), the \fB{PRIV_FILE_DOWNGRADE_SL}\fR privilege is required. Changing the dataset to labels other than the default can be done only when the dataset is not mounted. When a dataset with the default label is mounted into a labeled-zone, the mount operation automatically sets the \fBmlslabel\fR property to the label of that zone.

The reservation is kept equal to the volume's logical size to prevent unexpected behavior for consumers. Without the reservation, the volume could run out of space, resulting in undefined behavior or data corruption, depending on how the volume is used.

Indicates whether the file system should reject file names that include characters that are not present in the \fBUTF-8\fR character code set. If this property is explicitly set to \fBoff\fR, the normalization property must either not be explicitly set or be set to \fBnone\fR. The default value for the \fButf8only\fR property is \fBoff\fR. This property cannot be changed after the file system is created.

.SS "Temporary Mount Point Properties"
.sp
.LP
When a file system is mounted, either through \fBmount\fR(8) for legacy mounts or the \fBzfs mount\fR command for normal file systems, its mount options are set according to its properties. The correlation between properties and mount options is as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
    PROPERTY                MOUNT OPTION
     devices                 devices/nodevices
     exec                    exec/noexec
     readonly                ro/rw
     setuid                  setuid/nosetuid
     xattr                   xattr/noxattr
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
In addition, these options can be set on a per-mount basis using the \fB-o\fR option, without affecting the property that is stored on disk. The values specified on the command line override the values stored in the dataset. The \fB-nosuid\fR option is an alias for \fBnodevices,nosetuid\fR. These properties are reported as "temporary" by the \fBzfs get\fR command. If the properties are changed while the dataset is mounted, the new setting overrides any temporary settings.
.SS "User Properties"
.sp
.LP
In addition to the standard native properties, \fBZFS\fR supports arbitrary user properties. User properties have no effect on \fBZFS\fR behavior, but applications or administrators can use them to annotate datasets (file systems, volumes, and snapshots).
.sp
.LP
User property names must contain a colon (\fB:\fR) character to distinguish them from native properties. They may contain lowercase letters, numbers, and the following punctuation characters: colon (\fB:\fR), dash (\fB-\fR), period (\fB\&.\fR), and underscore (\fB_\fR). The expected convention is that the property name is divided into two portions such as \fImodule\fR\fB:\fR\fIproperty\fR, but this namespace is not enforced by \fBZFS\fR. User property names can be at most 256 characters, and cannot begin with a dash (\fB-\fR).
.sp
.LP
When making programmatic use of user properties, it is strongly suggested to use a reversed \fBDNS\fR domain name for the \fImodule\fR component of property names to reduce the chance that two independently-developed packages use the same property name for different purposes. For example, property names beginning with \fBcom.sun\fR. are reserved for use by Oracle Corporation (which acquired Sun Microsystems).
.sp
.LP
The values of user properties are arbitrary strings, are always inherited, and are never validated. All of the commands that operate on properties (\fBzfs list\fR, \fBzfs get\fR, \fBzfs set\fR, and so forth) can be used to manipulate both native properties and user properties. Use the \fBzfs inherit\fR command to clear a user property . If the property is not defined in any parent dataset, it is removed entirely. Property values are limited to 1024 characters.

Creates a snapshot whose contents are as specified in the stream provided on standard input. If a full stream is received, then a new file system is created as well. Streams are created using the \fBzfs send\fR subcommand, which by default creates a full stream. \fBzfs recv\fR can be used as an alias for \fBzfs receive\fR.

If an incremental stream is received, then the destination file system must already exist, and its most recent snapshot must match the incremental stream's source.
