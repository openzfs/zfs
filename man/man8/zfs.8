.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBzfs\fR command configures \fBZFS\fR datasets within a \fBZFS\fR storage pool, as described in \fBzpool\fR(8). A dataset is identified by a unique path within the \fBZFS\fR namespace. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
pool/{filesystem,volume,snapshot}
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
where the maximum length of a dataset name is \fBMAXNAMELEN\fR (256 bytes).
.sp
.LP
A dataset can be one of the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIfile system\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A \fBZFS\fR dataset of type \fBfilesystem\fR can be mounted within the standard system namespace and behaves like other file systems. While \fBZFS\fR file systems are designed to be \fBPOSIX\fR compliant, known issues exist that prevent compliance in some cases. Applications that depend on standards conformance might fail due to nonstandard behavior when checking file system free space.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIvolume\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A logical volume exported as a raw or block device. This type of dataset should only be used under special circumstances. File systems are typically used in most environments.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIsnapshot\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A read-only version of a file system or volume at a given point in time. It is specified as \fIfilesystem@name\fR or \fIvolume@name\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIbookmark\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Much like a \fIsnapshot\fR, but without the hold on on-disk data. It can be used as the source of a send (but not for a receive).
It is specified as \fIfilesystem#name\fR or \fIvolume#name\fR.
.RE

.SS "ZFS File System Hierarchy"
.LP
A \fBZFS\fR storage pool is a logical collection of devices that provide space for datasets. A storage pool is also the root of the \fBZFS\fR file system hierarchy.
.sp
.LP
The root of the pool can be accessed as a file system, such as mounting and unmounting, taking snapshots, and setting properties. The physical storage characteristics, however, are managed by the \fBzpool\fR(8) command.
.sp
.LP
See \fBzpool\fR(8) for more information on creating and administering pools.
.SS "Snapshots"
.LP
A snapshot is a read-only copy of a file system or volume. Snapshots can be created extremely quickly, and initially consume no additional space within the pool. As data within the active dataset changes, the snapshot consumes more data than would otherwise be shared with the active dataset.
.sp
.LP
Snapshots can have arbitrary names. Snapshots of volumes can be cloned or rolled back.  Visibility is determined by the \fBsnapdev\fR property of the parent volume.
.sp
.LP
File system snapshots can be accessed under the \fB\&.zfs/snapshot\fR directory in the root of the file system. Snapshots are automatically mounted on demand and may be unmounted at regular intervals. The visibility of the \fB\&.zfs\fR directory can be controlled by the \fBsnapdir\fR property.
.SS "Bookmarks"
.LP
A bookmark is like a snapshot, a read-only copy of a file system or volume. Bookmarks can be created extremely quickly, compared to snapshots, and they consume no additional space within the pool.  Bookmarks can also have arbitrary names, much like snapshots.
.sp
.LP
Unlike snapshots, bookmarks can not be accessed through the filesystem in any way. From a storage standpoint a bookmark just provides a way to reference when a snapshot was created as a distinct object.  Bookmarks are initially tied to a snapshot, not the filesystem/volume, and they will survive if the snapshot itself is destroyed.  Since they are very light weight there's little incentive to destroy them.
.SS "Clones"
.LP
A clone is a writable volume or file system whose initial contents are the same as another dataset. As with snapshots, creating a clone is nearly instantaneous, and initially consumes no additional space.
.sp
.LP
Clones can only be created from a snapshot. When a snapshot is cloned, it creates an implicit dependency between the parent and child. Even though the clone is created somewhere else in the dataset hierarchy, the original snapshot cannot be destroyed as long as a clone exists. The \fBorigin\fR property exposes this dependency, and the \fBdestroy\fR command lists any such dependencies, if they exist.
.sp
.LP
The clone parent-child dependency relationship can be reversed by using the \fBpromote\fR subcommand. This causes the "origin" file system to become a clone of the specified file system, which makes it possible to destroy the file system that the clone was created from.
.SS "Mount Points"
.LP
Creating a \fBZFS\fR file system is a simple operation, so the number of file systems per system is likely to be numerous. To cope with this, \fBZFS\fR automatically manages mounting and unmounting file systems without the need to edit the \fB/etc/fstab\fR file. All automatically managed file systems are mounted by \fBZFS\fR at boot time.
.sp
.LP
By default, file systems are mounted under \fB/\fIpath\fR\fR, where \fIpath\fR is the name of the file system in the \fBZFS\fR namespace. Directories are created and destroyed as needed.
.sp
.LP
A file system can also have a mount point set in the \fBmountpoint\fR property. This directory is created as needed, and \fBZFS\fR automatically mounts the file system when the \fBzfs mount -a\fR command is invoked (without editing \fB/etc/fstab\fR). The \fBmountpoint\fR property can be inherited, so if \fBpool/home\fR has a mount point of \fB/export/stuff\fR, then \fBpool/home/user\fR automatically inherits a mount point of \fB/export/stuff/user\fR.
.sp
.LP
A file system \fBmountpoint\fR property of \fBnone\fR prevents the file system from being mounted.
.sp
.LP
If needed, \fBZFS\fR file systems can also be managed with traditional tools (\fBmount\fR, \fBumount\fR, \fB/etc/fstab\fR). If a file system's mount point is set to \fBlegacy\fR, \fBZFS\fR makes no attempt to manage the file system, and the administrator is responsible for mounting and unmounting the file system.
.SS "Deduplication"
.LP
Deduplication is the process for removing redundant data at the block-level, reducing the total amount of data stored. If a file system has the \fBdedup\fR property enabled, duplicate data blocks are removed synchronously.  The result is that only unique data is stored and common components are shared among files.
.sp
\fBWARNING: DO NOT ENABLE DEDUPLICATION UNLESS YOU NEED IT AND KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE DOING!\fR
.sp
Deduplicating data is a very resource-intensive operation. It is generally recommended that you have \fIat least\fR 1.25 GB of RAM per 1 TB of storage when you enable deduplication. But calculating the exact requirenments is a somewhat complicated affair. Please see the \fBOracle Dedup Guide\fR for more information..
.sp
Enabling deduplication on an improperly-designed system will result in extreme performance issues (extremely slow filesystem and snapshot deletions etc.) and can potentially lead to data loss (i.e. unimportable pool due to memory exhaustion) if your system is not built for this purpose. Deduplication affects the processing power (CPU), disks (and the controller) as well as primary (real) memory.
.sp
Before creating a pool with deduplication enabled, ensure that you have planned your hardware requirements appropriately and implemented appropriate recovery practices, such as regular backups.
.sp
Unless necessary, deduplication should NOT be enabled on a system. Instead, consider using \fIcompression=lz4\fR, as a less resource-intensive alternative.
.SS "Native Properties"
.LP
Properties are divided into two types, native properties and user-defined (or "user") properties. Native properties either export internal statistics or control \fBZFS\fR behavior. In addition, native properties are either editable or read-only. User properties have no effect on \fBZFS\fR behavior, but you can use them to annotate datasets in a way that is meaningful in your environment. For more information about user properties, see the "User Properties" section, below.
.sp
.LP
Every dataset has a set of properties that export statistics about the dataset as well as control various behaviors. Properties are inherited from the parent unless overridden by the child. Some properties apply only to certain types of datasets (file systems, volumes, or snapshots).
.sp
.LP
The values of numeric properties can be specified using human-readable suffixes (for example, \fBk\fR, \fBKB\fR, \fBM\fR, \fBGb\fR, and so forth, up to \fBZ\fR for zettabyte). The following are all valid (and equal) specifications: 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
1536M, 1.5g, 1.50GB
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The values of non-numeric properties are case sensitive and must be lowercase, except for \fBmountpoint\fR, \fBsharenfs\fR, and \fBsharesmb\fR.
.sp
.LP
The following native properties consist of read-only statistics about the dataset. These properties can be neither set, nor inherited. Native properties apply to all dataset types unless otherwise noted.

The amount of space consumed by this dataset and all its descendents. This is the value that is checked against this dataset's quota and reservation. The space used does not include this dataset's reservation, but does take into account the reservations of any descendent datasets. The amount of space that a dataset consumes from its parent, as well as the amount of space that are freed if this dataset is recursively destroyed, is the greater of its space used and its reservation.
.sp
When snapshots (see the "Snapshots" section) are created, their space is initially shared between the snapshot and the file system, and possibly with previous snapshots. As the file system changes, space that was previously shared becomes unique to the snapshot, and counted in the snapshot's space used. Additionally, deleting snapshots can increase the amount of space unique to (and used by) other snapshots.
.sp
The amount of space used, available, or referenced does not take into account pending changes. Pending changes are generally accounted for within a few seconds.

.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Controls how \fBACL\fR entries are inherited when files and directories are created. A file system with an \fBaclinherit\fR property of \fBdiscard\fR does not inherit any \fBACL\fR entries. A file system with an \fBaclinherit\fR property value of \fBnoallow\fR only inherits inheritable \fBACL\fR entries that specify "deny" permissions. The property value \fBrestricted\fR (the default) removes the \fBwrite_acl\fR and \fBwrite_owner\fR permissions when the \fBACL\fR entry is inherited. A file system with an \fBaclinherit\fR property value of \fBpassthrough\fR inherits all inheritable \fBACL\fR entries without any modifications made to the \fBACL\fR entries when they are inherited. A file system with an \fBaclinherit\fR property value of \fBpassthrough-x\fR has the same meaning as \fBpassthrough\fR, except that the \fBowner@\fR, \fBgroup@\fR, and \fBeveryone@\fR \fBACE\fRs inherit the execute permission only if the file creation mode also requests the execute bit.
.sp
When the property value is set to \fBpassthrough\fR, files are created with a mode determined by the inheritable \fBACE\fRs. If no inheritable \fBACE\fRs exist that affect the mode, then the mode is set in accordance to the requested mode from the application.

Controls whether ACLs are enabled and if so what type of ACL to use.  When
a file system has the \fBacltype\fR property set to \fBnoacl\fR (the default)
then ACLs are disabled.  Setting the \fBacltype\fR property to \fBposixacl\fR
indicates Posix ACLs should be used.  Posix ACLs are specific to Linux and
are not functional on other platforms.  Posix ACLs are stored as an xattr and
therefore will not overwrite any existing ZFS/NFSv4 ACLs which may be set.
Currently only \fBposixacls\fR are supported on Linux.
.sp
To obtain the best performance when setting \fBposixacl\fR users are strongly
encouraged to set the \fBxattr=sa\fR property.  This will result in the
Posix ACL being stored more efficiently on disk.  But as a consequence of this
all new xattrs will only be accessible from ZFS implementations which support
the \fBxattr=sa\fR property.  See the \fBxattr\fR property for more details.

If this property is set to \fBoff\fR, the file system cannot be mounted, and is ignored by \fBzfs mount -a\fR. Setting this property to \fBoff\fR is similar to setting the \fBmountpoint\fR property to \fBnone\fR, except that the dataset still has a normal \fBmountpoint\fR property, which can be inherited. Setting this property to \fBoff\fR allows datasets to be used solely as a mechanism to inherit properties. One example of setting \fBcanmount=\fR\fBoff\fR is to have two datasets with the same \fBmountpoint\fR, so that the children of both datasets appear in the same directory, but might have different inherited characteristics.

When the \fBnoauto\fR option is set, a dataset can only be mounted and unmounted explicitly. The dataset is not mounted automatically when the dataset is created or imported, nor is it mounted by the \fBzfs mount -a\fR command or unmounted by the \fBzfs unmount -a\fR command.

.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Controls the compression algorithm used for this dataset.
.sp
Setting compression to \fBon\fR indicates that the current default
compression algorithm should be used.  The default balances compression
and decompression speed, with compression ratio and is expected to
work well on a wide variety of workloads.  Unlike all other settings for
this property, \fBon\fR does not select a fixed compression type.  As
new compression algorithms are added to ZFS and enabled on a pool, the
default compression algorithm may change.  The current default compression
algorthm is either \fBlzjb\fR or, if the \fBlz4_compress\fR feature is
enabled, \fBlz4\fR.
.sp
The \fBlzjb\fR compression algorithm is optimized for performance while
providing decent data compression.
.sp
The \fBlz4\fR compression algorithm is a high-performance replacement
for the \fBlzjb\fR algorithm. It features significantly faster
compression and decompression, as well as a moderately higher
compression ratio than \fBlzjb\fR, but can only be used on pools with
the \fBlz4_compress\fR feature set to \fIenabled\fR. See
\fBzpool-features\fR(5) for details on ZFS feature flags and the
\fBlz4_compress\fR feature.
.sp
The \fBgzip\fR compression algorithm uses the same compression as
the \fBgzip\fR(1) command. You can specify the \fBgzip\fR level by using the
value \fBgzip-\fR\fIN\fR where \fIN\fR is an integer from 1 (fastest) to 9
(best compression ratio). Currently, \fBgzip\fR is equivalent to \fBgzip-6\fR
(which is also the default for \fBgzip\fR(1)). The \fBzle\fR compression
algorithm compresses runs of zeros.

When the \fBmlslabel\fR property is not set, the default value is \fBnone\fR. Setting the  \fBmlslabel\fR property to \fBnone\fR is equivalent to removing the property.
.sp
The \fBmlslabel\fR property can be modified only when Trusted Extensions is enabled and only with appropriate privilege. Rights to modify it cannot be delegated. When changing a label to a higher label or setting the initial dataset label, the \fB{PRIV_FILE_UPGRADE_SL}\fR privilege is required. When changing a label to a lower label or the default (\fBnone\fR), the \fB{PRIV_FILE_DOWNGRADE_SL}\fR privilege is required. Changing the dataset to labels other than the default can be done only when the dataset is not mounted. When a dataset with the default label is mounted into a labeled-zone, the mount operation automatically sets the \fBmlslabel\fR property to the label of that zone.

Controls whether the file system is shared via \fBNFS\fR, and what options are used. A file system with a \fBsharenfs\fR property of \fBoff\fR is managed with the \fBexportfs\fR(8) command and entries in \fB/etc/exports\fR file.

Controls the behavior of synchronous requests (e.g. fsync, O_DSYNC).
\fBstandard\fR is the POSIX specified behavior of ensuring all synchronous
requests are written to stable storage and all devices are flushed to ensure
data is not cached by device controllers (this is the default). \fBalways\fR
causes every file system transaction to be written and flushed before its
system call returns. This has a large performance penalty. \fBdisabled\fR
disables synchronous requests. File system transactions are only committed to
stable storage periodically. This option will give the highest performance.
However, it is very dangerous as ZFS would be ignoring the synchronous
transaction demands of applications such as databases or NFS.  Administrators
should only use this option when the risks are understood.

For volumes, specifies the logical size of the volume. By default, creating a volume establishes a reservation of equal size. For storage pools with a version number of 9 or higher, a \fBrefreservation\fR is set instead. Any changes to \fBvolsize\fR are reflected in an equivalent change to the reservation (or \fBrefreservation\fR). The \fBvolsize\fR can only be set to a multiple of \fBvolblocksize\fR, and cannot be zero.
.sp
The reservation is kept equal to the volume's logical size to prevent unexpected behavior for consumers. Without the reservation, the volume could run out of space, resulting in undefined behavior or data corruption, depending on how the volume is used. These effects can also occur when the volume size is changed while it is in use (particularly when shrinking the size). Extreme care should be used when adjusting the volume size.
.sp
Though not recommended, a "sparse volume" (also known as "thin provisioning") can be created by specifying the \fB-s\fR option to the \fBzfs create -V\fR command, or by changing the reservation after the volume has been created. A "sparse volume" is a volume where the reservation is less then the volume size. Consequently, writes to a sparse volume can fail with \fBENOSPC\fR when the pool is low on space. For a sparse volume, changes to \fBvolsize\fR are not reflected in the reservation.

Controls whether extended attributes are enabled for this file system.  Two

attribute based.
.sp
The default value of \fBon\fR enables directory based extended attributes.
This style of xattr imposes no practical limit on either the size or number of
xattrs which may be set on a file.  Although under Linux the \fBgetxattr\fR(2)
and \fBsetxattr\fR(2) system calls limit the maximum xattr size to 64K.  This
is the most compatible style of xattr and it is supported by the majority of
ZFS implementations.
.sp
System attribute based xattrs may be enabled by setting the value to \fBsa\fR.
The key advantage of this type of xattr is improved performance.  Storing
xattrs as system attributes significantly decreases the amount of disk IO
required.  Up to 64K of xattr data may be stored per file in the space reserved
for system attributes.  If there is not enough space available for an xattr then
it will be automatically written as a directory based xattr.  System attribute
based xattrs are not accessible on platforms which do not support the
\fBxattr=sa\fR feature.
.sp
The use of system attribute based xattrs is strongly encouraged for users of
SELinux or Posix ACLs.  Both of these features heavily rely of xattrs and
benefit significantly from the reduced xattr access time.

.SS "Temporary Mount Point Properties"
.LP
When a file system is mounted, either through \fBmount\fR(8) for legacy mounts or the \fBzfs mount\fR command for normal file systems, its mount options are set according to its properties. The correlation between properties and mount options is as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
    PROPERTY                MOUNT OPTION
     devices                 devices/nodevices

     readonly                ro/rw
     setuid                  setuid/nosetuid
     xattr                   xattr/noxattr
     atime                   atime/noatime
     relatime                relatime/norelatime
     nbmand                  nbmand/nonbmand
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
In addition, these options can be set on a per-mount basis using the \fB-o\fR option, without affecting the property that is stored on disk. The values specified on the command line override the values stored in the dataset. The \fB-nosuid\fR option is an alias for \fBnodevices,nosetuid\fR. These properties are reported as "temporary" by the \fBzfs get\fR command. If the properties are changed while the dataset is mounted, the new setting overrides any temporary settings.
.SS "User Properties"
.LP
In addition to the standard native properties, \fBZFS\fR supports arbitrary user properties. User properties have no effect on \fBZFS\fR behavior, but applications or administrators can use them to annotate datasets (file systems, volumes, and snapshots).
.sp
.LP
User property names must contain a colon (\fB:\fR) character to distinguish them from native properties. They may contain lowercase letters, numbers, and the following punctuation characters: colon (\fB:\fR), dash (\fB-\fR), period (\fB\&.\fR), and underscore (\fB_\fR). The expected convention is that the property name is divided into two portions such as \fImodule\fR\fB:\fR\fIproperty\fR, but this namespace is not enforced by \fBZFS\fR. User property names can be at most 256 characters, and cannot begin with a dash (\fB-\fR).
.sp
.LP
When making programmatic use of user properties, it is strongly suggested to use a reversed \fBDNS\fR domain name for the \fImodule\fR component of property names to reduce the chance that two independently-developed packages use the same property name for different purposes. For example, property names beginning with \fBcom.sun\fR. are reserved for use by Oracle Corporation (which acquired Sun Microsystems).
.sp
.LP
The values of user properties are arbitrary strings, are always inherited, and are never validated. All of the commands that operate on properties (\fBzfs list\fR, \fBzfs get\fR, \fBzfs set\fR, and so forth) can be used to manipulate both native properties and user properties. Use the \fBzfs inherit\fR command to clear a user property . If the property is not defined in any parent dataset, it is removed entirely. Property values are limited to 1024 characters.
.SS "ZFS Volumes as Swap"

Promotes a clone file system to no longer be dependent on its "origin" snapshot. This makes it possible to destroy the file system that the clone was created from. The clone parent-child dependency relationship is reversed, so that the origin file system becomes a clone of the specified file system. 
.sp
The snapshot that was cloned, and any snapshots previous to this snapshot, are now owned by the promoted clone. The space they use moves from the origin file system to the promoted clone, so enough space must be available to accommodate these snapshots. No new space is consumed by this operation, but the space accounting is adjusted. The promoted clone must not have any conflicting snapshot names of its own. The \fBrename\fR subcommand can be used to rename any conflicting snapshots.

Creates a snapshot whose contents are as specified in the stream provided on standard input. If a full stream is received, then a new file system is created as well. Streams are created using the \fBzfs send\fR subcommand, which by default creates a full stream. \fBzfs recv\fR can be used as an alias for \fBzfs receive\fR.
.sp
If an incremental stream is received, then the destination file system must already exist, and its most recent snapshot must match the incremental stream's source.

The name of the snapshot (and file system, if a full stream is received) that this subcommand creates depends on the argument type and the use of the \fB-d\fR or \fB-e\fR options.

If the argument is a snapshot name, the specified \fIsnapshot\fR is created. If the argument is a file system or volume name, a snapshot with the same name as the sent snapshot is created within the specified \fIfilesystem\fR or \fIvolume\fR.  If neither of the \fB-d\fR or \fB-e\fR options are specified, the provided target snapshot name is used exactly as provided.
.sp
The \fB-d\fR and \fB-e\fR options cause the file system name of the target snapshot to be determined by appending a portion of the sent snapshot's name to the specified target \fIfilesystem\fR.
