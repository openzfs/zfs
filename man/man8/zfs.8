.Dt ZFS 8
.Os Linux
.Sh NAME
.Nm zfs
.Nd configures ZFS file systems
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Fl ?V
.Nm
.Cm version
.Nm
.Cm <subcommand>
.Op Ar <args>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command configures ZFS datasets within a ZFS storage pool, as described in
.Xr zpool 8 .
A dataset is identified by a unique path within the ZFS namespace.
For example:
.Bd -literal
pool/{filesystem,volume,snapshot}
.Ed
.Pp
where the maximum length of a dataset name is
.Dv MAXNAMELEN
.Pq 256 bytes
and the maximum amount of nesting allowed in a path is 50 levels deep.
.Pp
A dataset can be one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width "file system"
.It Sy file system
A ZFS dataset of type
.Sy filesystem
can be mounted within the standard system namespace and behaves like other file
systems.
While ZFS file systems are designed to be POSIX compliant, known issues exist
that prevent compliance in some cases.
Applications that depend on standards conformance might fail due to non-standard
behavior when checking file system free space.
.It Sy volume
A logical volume exported as a raw or block device.
This type of dataset should only be used when a block device is required.
File systems are typically used in most environments.
.It Sy snapshot
A read-only version of a file system or volume at a given point in time.
It is specified as
.Ar filesystem Ns @ Ns Ar name
or
.Ar volume Ns @ Ns Ar name .
.It Sy bookmark
Much like a
.Sy snapshot ,
but without the hold on on-disk data.
It can be used as the source of a send (but not for a receive). It is specified as
.Ar filesystem Ns # Ns Ar name
or
.Ar volume Ns # Ns Ar name .
.El
.Pp
For details see
.Xr zfsconcepts 8 .
.Ss Properties
Properties are divided into two types, native properties and user-defined
.Po or
.Qq user
.Pc
properties.
Native properties either export internal statistics or control ZFS behavior.
In addition, native properties are either editable or read-only.
User properties have no effect on ZFS behavior, but you can use them to annotate
datasets in a way that is meaningful in your environment.
For more information about properties, see the
.Xr zfsprops 8 man page.
.Ss Encryption
Enabling the
.Sy encryption
feature allows for the creation of encrypted filesystems and volumes.
ZFS will encrypt file and zvol data, file attributes, ACLs, permission bits,
directory listings, FUID mappings, and
.Sy userused
/
.Sy groupused
data.
For an overview of encryption see the
.Xr zfs-load-key 8 command manual.
.Sh SUBCOMMANDS
All subcommands that modify state are logged persistently to the pool in their
original form.
.Bl -tag -width ""
.It Nm Fl ?

Roll back the given dataset to a previous snapshot.
.It Xo
.Xr zfs-hold 8 /

If a hold exists on a snapshot, attempts to destroy that snapshot by using the
.Nm zfs Cm destroy
command return
.Er EBUSY .
.It Xr zfs-diff 8
Display the difference between a snapshot of a given filesystem and another
snapshot of that filesystem from a later time or the current contents of the
filesystem.

snapshot.
.El
.Ss Send & Receive
.Bl -tag -width ""
.It Xr zfs-send 8
Generate a send stream, which may be of a filesystem, and may be incremental
from a bookmark.
.It Xr zfs-receive 8
Creates a snapshot whose contents are as specified in the stream provided on
standard input.
If a full stream is received, then a new file system is created as well.
Streams are created using the
.Xr zfs-send 8
subcommand, which by default creates a full stream.
.It Xr zfs-bookmark 8
Creates a new bookmark of the given snapshot or bookmark.
Bookmarks mark the point in time when the snapshot was created, and can be used
as the incremental source for a
.Nm zfs Cm send
command.
.It Xr zfs-redact 8
Generate a new redaction bookmark.
This feature can be used to allow clones of a filesystem to be made available on
a remote system, in the case where their parent need not (or needs to not) be
usable.

.It Sy Example 1 No Creating a ZFS File System Hierarchy
The following commands create a file system named
.Em pool/home
and a file system named
.Em pool/home/bob .
The mount point
.Pa /export/home
is set for the parent file system, and is automatically inherited by the child
file system.

.Ed
.It Sy Example 3 No Creating and Destroying Multiple Snapshots
The following command creates snapshots named
.Sy yesterday

to the snapshot named
.Sy yesterday ,
deleting all intermediate snapshots.
.Bd -literal
# zfs rollback -r pool/home/anne@yesterday
.Ed
.It Sy Example 9 No Creating a ZFS Clone
The following command creates a writable file system whose initial contents are
the same as
.Em pool/home/bob@yesterday .
.Bd -literal
# zfs clone pool/home/bob@yesterday pool/clone
.Ed
.It Sy Example 10 No Promoting a ZFS Clone
The following commands illustrate how to test out changes to a file system, and
then replace the original file system with the changed one, using clones, clone
promotion, and renaming:
.Bd -literal
# zfs create pool/project/production
  populate /pool/project/production with data
# zfs snapshot pool/project/production@today
# zfs clone pool/project/production@today pool/project/beta
  make changes to /pool/project/beta and test them
# zfs promote pool/project/beta

# zfs rename pool/project/beta pool/project/production
  once the legacy version is no longer needed, it can be destroyed
# zfs destroy pool/project/legacy
.Ed
.It Sy Example 11 No Inheriting ZFS Properties
The following command causes

.Bd -literal
# zfs inherit checksum pool/home/bob pool/home/anne
.Ed
.It Sy Example 12 No Remotely Replicating ZFS Data
The following commands send a full stream and then an incremental stream to a
remote machine, restoring them into
.Em poolB/received/fs@a
and
.Em poolB/received/fs@b ,
respectively.
.Em poolB
must contain the file system
.Em poolB/received ,
and must not initially contain
.Em poolB/received/fs .
.Bd -literal
# zfs send pool/fs@a | \e
  ssh host zfs receive poolB/received/fs@a
# zfs send -i a pool/fs@b | \e
  ssh host zfs receive poolB/received/fs
.Ed
.It Sy Example 13 No Using the zfs receive -d Option
The following command sends a full stream of
.Em poolA/fsA/fsB@snap
to a remote machine, receiving it into
.Em poolB/received/fsA/fsB@snap .
The
.Em fsA/fsB@snap
portion of the received snapshot's name is determined from the name of the sent
snapshot.
.Em poolB
must contain the file system
.Em poolB/received .
If
.Em poolB/received/fsA
does not exist, it is created as an empty file system.
.Bd -literal
# zfs send poolA/fsA/fsB@snap | \e
  ssh host zfs receive -d poolB/received
.Ed
.It Sy Example 14 No Setting User Properties
The following example sets the user-defined
.Sy com.example:department
property for a dataset.
.Bd -literal

.Ed
.It Sy Example 15 No Performing a Rolling Snapshot
The following example shows how to maintain a history of snapshots with a
consistent naming scheme.
To keep a week's worth of snapshots, the user destroys the oldest snapshot,
renames the remaining snapshots, and then creates a new snapshot, as follows:
.Bd -literal
# zfs destroy -r pool/users@7daysago
# zfs rename -r pool/users@6daysago @7daysago
# zfs rename -r pool/users@5daysago @6daysago
# zfs rename -r pool/users@4daysago @5daysago

.It Sy Example 16 No Setting sharenfs Property Options on a ZFS File System
The following commands show how to set
.Sy sharenfs
property options to enable
.Sy rw
access for a set of

.Pp
Because the
.Em tank/cindys
mount point permission is set to 755 by default, user
.Sy cindys
will be unable to mount file systems under

.It Sy Example 18 No Delegating Create Time Permissions on a ZFS Dataset
The following example shows how to grant anyone in the group

The
.Fl F
option is used to indicate type information for the files affected.
.Bd -literal
# zfs diff -F tank/test@before tank/test
M       /       /tank/test/
M       F       /tank/test/linked      (+1)
R       F       /tank/test/oldname -> /tank/test/newname
-       F       /tank/test/deleted
+       F       /tank/test/created
M       F       /tank/test/modified
.Ed
.It Sy Example 23 No Creating a bookmark

.Pp
Minimal
.Em /etc/samba/smb.conf
configuration required:
.Pp
Samba will need to listen to 'localhost' (127.0.0.1) for the ZFS utilities to
communicate with Samba.
This is the default behavior for most Linux distributions.
.Pp
Samba must be able to authenticate a user.
This can be done in a number of ways, depending on if using the system password file, LDAP or the Samba
specific smbpasswd file.
How to do this is outside the scope of this manual.
Please refer to the
.Xr smb.conf 5
man page for more information.
.Pp
See the
.Sy USERSHARE section
of the
.Xr smb.conf 5
man page for all configuration options in case you need to modify any options
to the share afterwards.
Do note that any changes done with the
.Xr net 8
command will be undone if the share is ever unshared (such as at a reboot etc).
