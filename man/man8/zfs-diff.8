.Sh DESCRIPTION
Display the difference between a snapshot of a given filesystem and another
snapshot of that filesystem from a later time or the current contents of the

The first column is a character indicating the type of change, the other columns
indicate pathname, new pathname
.Pq in case of rename ,
change in link count, and optionally file type and/or change time.
The types of change are:
.Bl -tag -compact -offset Ds -width "M"
.It Sy -

.It Sy +
The path has been created
.It Sy M
The path has been modified
.It Sy R

.El
.Bl -tag -width "-F"
.It Fl F

.Sh EXAMPLES
.\" These are, respectively, examples 22 from zfs.8
.\" Make sure to update them bidirectionally
.Ss Example 1 : No Showing the differences between a snapshot and a ZFS Dataset
The following example shows how to see what has changed between a prior
snapshot of a ZFS dataset and its current state.
The
.Fl F
option is used to indicate type information for the files affected.
.Bd -literal -compact -offset Ds
.No # Nm zfs Cm diff Fl F Ar tank/test@before tank/test
M       /       /tank/test/
M       F       /tank/test/linked      (+1)
R       F       /tank/test/oldname -> /tank/test/newname
-       F       /tank/test/deleted
+       F       /tank/test/created
