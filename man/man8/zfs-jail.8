.Dt ZFS-JAIL 8
.Os
.
.Sh NAME
.Nm zfs-jail
.Nd attach or detach ZFS filesystem from FreeBSD jail
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm zfs Cm jail
.Ar jailid Ns | Ns Ar jailname
.Ar filesystem
.Nm zfs Cm unjail
.Ar jailid Ns | Ns Ar jailname
.Ar filesystem
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bl -tag -width ""
.It Xo
.Nm zfs
.Cm jail
.Ar jailid Ns | Ns Ar jailname
.Ar filesystem
.Xc
Attach the specified
.Ar filesystem
to the jail identified by JID
.Ar jailid
or name
.Ar jailname .
From now on this file system tree can be managed from within a jail if the
.Sy jailed
property has been set.
To use this functionality, the jail needs the
.Sy allow.mount
and
.Sy allow.mount.zfs
parameters set to
.Sy 1
and the
.Sy enforce_statfs
parameter set to a value lower than
.Sy 2 .
.Pp
You cannot attach a jailed dataset's children to another jail.
You can also not attach the root file system
of the jail or any dataset which needs to be mounted before the zfs rc script
is run inside the jail, as it would be attached unmounted until it is
mounted from the rc script inside the jail.
.Pp
To allow management of the dataset from within a jail, the
.Sy jailed
property has to be set and the jail needs access to the
.Pa /dev/zfs
device.
The
.Sy quota
property cannot be changed from within a jail.
.Pp
After a dataset is attached to a jail and the
.Sy jailed
property is set, a jailed file system cannot be mounted outside the jail,
since the jail administrator might have set the mount point to an unacceptable value.
.Pp
See
.Xr jail 8
for more information on managing jails.
Jails are a
.Fx
feature and are not relevant on other platforms.

.Cm unjail
.Ar jailid Ns | Ns Ar jailname
