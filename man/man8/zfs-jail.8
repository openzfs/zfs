.Dt ZFS-JAIL 8
.Os FreeBSD
.Sh NAME
.Nm zfs-jail
.Nd Attaches and detaches ZFS filesystems from FreeBSD jails.
.No A Tn ZFS
dataset can be attached to a jail by using the
.Qq Nm Cm jail
subcommand. You cannot attach a dataset to one jail and the children of the
same dataset to another jail. You can also not attach the root file system
of the jail or any dataset which needs to be mounted before the zfs rc script
is run inside the jail, as it would be attached unmounted until it is
mounted from the rc script inside the jail. To allow management of the
dataset from within a jail, the
.Sy jailed
property has to be set and the jail needs access to the
.Pa /dev/zfs
device. The
.Sy quota
property cannot be changed from within a jail. See
.Xr jail 8
for information on how to allow mounting
.Tn ZFS
datasets from within a jail.
.Pp
.No A Tn ZFS
dataset can be detached from a jail using the
.Qq Nm Cm unjail
subcommand.
.Pp
After a dataset is attached to a jail and the jailed property is set, a jailed
file system cannot be mounted outside the jail, since the jail administrator
might have set the mount point to an unacceptable value.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm zfs
.Cm jail
.Ar jailid Ns | Ns Ar jailname filesystem
.Nm zfs
.Cm unjail
.Ar jailid Ns | Ns Ar jailname filesystem
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bl -tag -width ""
.It Xo
.Nm zfs
.Cm jail
.Ar jailid filesystem
.Xc
.Pp
Attaches the specified
.Ar filesystem
to the jail identified by JID
.Ar jailid .
From now on this file system tree can be managed from within a jail if the
.Sy jailed
property has been set. To use this functuinality, the jail needs the
.Va allow.mount
and
.Va allow.mount.zfs
parameters set to 1 and the
.Va enforce_statfs
parameter set to a value lower than 2.
.Pp
See
.Xr jail 8
for more information on managing jails and configuring the parameters above.
