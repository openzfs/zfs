.Sh NAME
.Nm zfs-promote
.Nd promote clone dataset to no longer depend on origin snapshot
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm zfs
.Cm promote
.Ar clone
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm zfs Cm promote
command makes it possible to destroy the dataset that the clone was created
from.
The clone parent-child dependency relationship is reversed, so that the origin
dataset becomes a clone of the specified dataset.
.Pp
The snapshot that was cloned, and any snapshots previous to this snapshot, are
now owned by the promoted clone.
The space they use moves from the origin dataset to the promoted clone, so
enough space must be available to accommodate these snapshots.
No new space is consumed by this operation, but the space accounting is
adjusted.
The promoted clone must not have any conflicting snapshot names of its own.
The
.Nm zfs Cm rename
subcommand can be used to rename any conflicting snapshots.
.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.\" These are, respectively, examples 10 from zfs.8
.\" Make sure to update them bidirectionally
.Ss Example 1 : No Promoting a ZFS Clone
The following commands illustrate how to test out changes to a file system, and
then replace the original file system with the changed one, using clones, clone
promotion, and renaming:
.Bd -literal -compact -offset Ds
.No # Nm zfs Cm create Ar pool/project/production
  populate /pool/project/production with data
.No # Nm zfs Cm snapshot Ar pool/project/production Ns @ Ns Ar today
.No # Nm zfs Cm clone Ar pool/project/production@today pool/project/beta
  make changes to /pool/project/beta and test them
.No # Nm zfs Cm promote Ar pool/project/beta
.No # Nm zfs Cm rename Ar pool/project/production pool/project/legacy
.No # Nm zfs Cm rename Ar pool/project/beta pool/project/production
  once the legacy version is no longer needed, it can be destroyed
.No # Nm zfs Cm destroy Ar pool/project/legacy
