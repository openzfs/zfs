.Sh NAME
.Nm zfs-promote
.Nd promote clone dataset to no longer depend on origin snapshot
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm zfs
.Cm promote
.Ar clone
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm zfs Cm promote
command makes it possible to destroy the dataset that the clone was created from.
The clone parent-child dependency relationship is reversed, so that the origin
dataset becomes a clone of the specified dataset.
.Pp
The snapshot that was cloned, and any snapshots previous to this snapshot, are
now owned by the promoted clone.
The space they use moves from the origin dataset to the promoted clone, so
enough space must be available to accommodate these snapshots.
No new space is consumed by this operation, but the space accounting is
adjusted.
The promoted clone must not have any conflicting snapshot names of its own.
The
.Nm zfs Cm rename
subcommand can be used to rename any conflicting snapshots.
