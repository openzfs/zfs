.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bl -tag -width ""
.It Xo
.Nm zfs
.Cm allow
.Ar filesystem Ns | Ns Ar volume
.Xc
Displays permissions that have been delegated on the specified filesystem or
volume.
See the other forms of
.Nm zfs Cm allow
for more information.
.Pp
Delegations are supported under Linux with the exception of
.Sy mount ,
.Sy unmount ,
.Sy mountpoint ,
.Sy canmount ,
.Sy rename ,
and
.Sy share .
These permissions cannot be delegated because the Linux
.Xr mount 8
command restricts modifications of the global namespace to the root user.

.Ar filesystem Ns | Ns Ar volume
.Xc
Delegates ZFS administration permission for the file systems to non-privileged
users.
.Bl -tag -width "-d"
.It Fl d
Allow only for the descendent file systems.
.It Fl e Ns | Ns Sy everyone
Specifies that the permissions be delegated to everyone.
.It Fl g Ar group Ns Oo , Ns Ar group Oc Ns …
Explicitly specify that permissions are delegated to the group.
.It Fl l
Allow
.Qq locally
only for the specified file system.
.It Fl u Ar user Ns Oo , Ns Ar user Oc Ns …
Explicitly specify that permissions are delegated to the user.
.It Ar user Ns | Ns Ar group Ns Oo , Ns Ar user Ns | Ns Ar group Oc Ns …
Specifies to whom the permissions are delegated.
Multiple entities can be specified as a comma-separated list.
If neither of the
.Fl gu
options are specified, then the argument is interpreted preferentially as the
keyword
.Sy everyone ,
then as a user name, and lastly as a group name.
To specify a user or group named
.Qq everyone ,
use the
.Fl g
or
.Fl u
options.
To specify a group with the same name as a user, use the
.Fl g
options.
.It Xo
.Ar perm Ns | Ns @ Ns Ar setname Ns Oo , Ns Ar perm Ns | Ns @ Ns
.Ar setname Oc Ns …
.Xc
The permissions to delegate.
Multiple permissions may be specified as a comma-separated list.
Permission names are the same as ZFS subcommand and property names.
See the property list below.
Property set names, which begin with
.Sy @ ,
may be specified.
See the
.Fl s
form below for details.
.El
.Pp
If neither of the
.Fl dl
options are specified, or both are, then the permissions are allowed for the
file system or volume, and all of its descendents.
.Pp
Permissions are generally the ability to use a ZFS subcommand or change a ZFS
property.
The following permissions are available:

to the creator of any newly-created descendent file system.

.Ar filesystem Ns | Ns Ar volume
.Xc
Defines or adds permissions to a permission set.
The set can be used by other
.Nm zfs Cm allow
commands for the specified file system and its descendents.
Sets are evaluated dynamically, so changes to a set are immediately reflected.
Permission sets follow the same naming restrictions as ZFS file systems, but the
name must begin with
.Sy @ ,
and can be no more than 64 characters long.

.Ar filesystem Ns | Ns Ar volume
.Xc
Removes permissions that were granted with the
.Nm zfs Cm allow
command.
No permissions are explicitly denied, so other permissions granted are still in
effect.
For example, if the permission is granted by an ancestor.
If no permissions are specified, then all permissions for the specified
.Ar user ,
.Ar group ,
or
.Sy everyone
are removed.
Specifying
.Sy everyone
.Po or using the
.Fl e
option
.Pc
only removes the permissions that were granted to everyone, not all permissions
for every user and group.
See the
.Nm zfs Cm allow
command for a description of the
.Fl ldugec
options.
.Bl -tag -width "-r"
.It Fl r
Recursively remove the permissions from this file system and all descendents.

Removes permissions from a permission set.
If no permissions are specified, then all permissions are removed, thus removing
the set entirely.
