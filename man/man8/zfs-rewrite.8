.Sh NOTES
Rewrite of cloned blocks and blocks that are part of any snapshots,
same as some property changes may increase pool space usage.
Holes that were never written or were previously zero-compressed are
not rewritten and will remain holes even if compression is disabled.
.Pp
Rewritten blocks will be seen as modified in next snapshot and as such
included into the incremental
.Nm zfs Cm send
stream.
.Pp
If a
.Fl l
or
.Fl o
value request a rewrite to regions past the end of the file, then those
regions are silently ignored, and no error is reported.
