.Nd initiate TRIM of free space in ZFS storage pool

.Nm zpool

.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Initiates an immediate on-demand TRIM operation for all of the free space in
a pool.
This operation informs the underlying storage devices of all blocks
in the pool which are no longer allocated and allows thinly provisioned
devices to reclaim the space.
.Pp
A manual on-demand TRIM operation can be initiated irrespective of the
.Sy autotrim
pool property setting.
See the documentation for the
.Sy autotrim
property above for the types of vdev devices which can be trimmed.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d , -secure
Causes a secure TRIM to be initiated.
When performing a secure TRIM, the
device guarantees that data stored on the trimmed blocks has been erased.
This requires support from the device and is not supported by all SSDs.
.It Fl r , -rate Ar rate
Controls the rate at which the TRIM operation progresses.
Without this
option TRIM is executed as quickly as possible.
The rate, expressed in bytes
per second, is applied on a per-vdev basis and may be set differently for
each leaf vdev.
.It Fl c , -cancel
Cancel trimming on the specified devices, or all eligible devices if none
are specified.
If one or more target devices are invalid or are not currently being
trimmed, the command will fail and no cancellation will occur on any device.
.It Fl s , -suspend
Suspend trimming on the specified devices, or all eligible devices if none
are specified.
If one or more target devices are invalid or are not currently being
trimmed, the command will fail and no suspension will occur on any device.
Trimming can then be resumed by running
.Nm zpool Cm trim
with no flags on the relevant target devices.
.It Fl w , -wait
Wait until the devices are done being trimmed before returning.
