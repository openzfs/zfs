.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Fl ?V
.Nm
.Cm version
.Nm
.Cm subcommand
.Op Ar argumentss
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command configures ZFS storage pools.
A storage pool is a collection of devices that provides physical storage and
data replication for ZFS datasets.
All datasets within a storage pool share the same space.
See
.Xr zfs 8
for information on managing datasets.
.Pp
For an overview of creating and managing ZFS storage pools see the
.Xr zpoolconcepts 7
manual page.
.
.Sh SUBCOMMANDS
All subcommands that modify state are logged persistently to the pool in their
original form.
.Pp
The
.Nm
command provides subcommands to create and destroy storage pools, add capacity
to storage pools, and provide information about the storage pools.
The following subcommands are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds

.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -tag -width "Exam"
.It Sy Example 1 : No Creating a RAID-Z Storage Pool
The following command creates a pool with a single raidz root vdev that
consists of six disks:
.Dl # Nm zpool Cm create Ar tank Sy raidz Ar sda sdb sdc sdd sde sdf
.
.It Sy Example 2 : No Creating a Mirrored Storage Pool
The following command creates a pool with two mirrors, where each mirror
contains two disks:
.Dl # Nm zpool Cm create Ar tank Sy mirror Ar sda sdb Sy mirror Ar sdc sdd
.
.It Sy Example 3 : No Creating a ZFS Storage Pool by Using Partitions
The following command creates an unmirrored pool using two disk partitions:
.Dl # Nm zpool Cm create Ar tank sda1 sdb2
.
.It Sy Example 4 : No Creating a ZFS Storage Pool by Using Files
The following command creates an unmirrored pool using files.
While not recommended, a pool based on files can be useful for experimental
purposes.
.Dl # Nm zpool Cm create Ar tank /path/to/file/a /path/to/file/b
.
.It Sy Example 5 : No Adding a Mirror to a ZFS Storage Pool
The following command adds two mirrored disks to the pool
.Ar tank ,
assuming the pool is already made up of two-way mirrors.
The additional space is immediately available to any datasets within the pool.
.Dl # Nm zpool Cm add Ar tank Sy mirror Ar sda sdb
.
.It Sy Example 6 : No Listing Available ZFS Storage Pools
The following command lists all available pools on the system.
In this case, the pool
.Ar zion
is faulted due to a missing device.
The results from this command are similar to the following:
.Bd -literal -compact -offset Ds
.No # Nm zpool Cm list
NAME    SIZE  ALLOC   FREE  EXPANDSZ   FRAG    CAP  DEDUP  HEALTH  ALTROOT
rpool  19.9G  8.43G  11.4G         -    33%    42%  1.00x  ONLINE  -

.Ed
.
.It Sy Example 7 : No Destroying a ZFS Storage Pool
The following command destroys the pool
.Ar tank
and any datasets contained within:
.Dl # Nm zpool Cm destroy Fl f Ar tank
.
.It Sy Example 8 : No Exporting a ZFS Storage Pool
The following command exports the devices in pool
.Ar tank
so that they can be relocated or later imported:
.Dl # Nm zpool Cm export Ar tank
.
.It Sy Example 9 : No Importing a ZFS Storage Pool
The following command displays available pools, and then imports the pool
.Ar tank
for use on the system.
The results from this command are similar to the following:
.Bd -literal -compact -offset Ds
.No # Nm zpool Cm import
  pool: tank
    id: 15451357997522795478
 state: ONLINE
action: The pool can be imported using its name or numeric identifier.
config:

        tank        ONLINE
          mirror    ONLINE
            sda     ONLINE
            sdb     ONLINE

.No # Nm zpool Cm import Ar tank
.Ed
.
.It Sy Example 10 : No Upgrading All ZFS Storage Pools to the Current Version
The following command upgrades all ZFS Storage pools to the current version of
the software:
.Bd -literal -compact -offset Ds
.No # Nm zpool Cm upgrade Fl a
This system is currently running ZFS version 2.
.Ed
.
.It Sy Example 11 : No Managing Hot Spares
The following command creates a new pool with an available hot spare:
.Dl # Nm zpool Cm create Ar tank Sy mirror Ar sda sdb Sy spare Ar sdc
.Pp
If one of the disks were to fail, the pool would be reduced to the degraded
state.
The failed device can be replaced using the following command:
.Dl # Nm zpool Cm replace Ar tank sda sdd
.Pp
Once the data has been resilvered, the spare is automatically removed and is
made available for use should another device fail.
The hot spare can be permanently removed from the pool using the following
command:
.Dl # Nm zpool Cm remove Ar tank sdc
.
.It Sy Example 12 : No Creating a ZFS Pool with Mirrored Separate Intent Logs
The following command creates a ZFS storage pool consisting of two, two-way
mirrors and mirrored log devices:
.Dl # Nm zpool Cm create Ar pool Sy mirror Ar sda sdb Sy mirror Ar sdc sdd Sy log mirror Ar sde sdf
.
.It Sy Example 13 : No Adding Cache Devices to a ZFS Pool
The following command adds two disks for use as cache devices to a ZFS storage
pool:
.Dl # Nm zpool Cm add Ar pool Sy cache Ar sdc sdd
.Pp
Once added, the cache devices gradually fill with content from main memory.
Depending on the size of your cache devices, it could take over an hour for
them to fill.
Capacity and reads can be monitored using the
.Cm iostat
subcommand as follows:
.Dl # Nm zpool Cm iostat Fl v Ar pool 5
.
.It Sy Example 14 : No Removing a Mirrored top-level (Log or Data) Device
The following commands remove the mirrored log device
.Sy mirror-2
and mirrored top-level data device
.Sy mirror-1 .
.Pp

.Pp
The command to remove the mirrored data
.Ar mirror-1 No is:

.It Sy Example 15 : No Displaying expanded space on a device
The following command displays the detailed information for the pool
.Ar data .
This pool is comprised of a single raidz vdev where one of its devices
increased its capacity by 10GB.
In this example, the pool will not be able to utilize this extra capacity until
all the devices under the raidz vdev have been expanded.

.Sh ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.Bl -tag -compact -width "ZPOOL_IMPORT_UDEV_TIMEOUT_MS"
.It Sy ZFS_ABORT
Cause
.Nm
to dump core on exit for the purposes of running
.Sy ::findleaks .
.It Sy ZFS_COLOR
Use ANSI color in
.Nm zpool status
output.
.It Sy ZPOOL_IMPORT_PATH
The search path for devices or files to use with the pool.
This is a colon-separated list of directories in which
.Nm
looks for device nodes and files.
Similar to the
.Fl d
option in
.Nm zpool import .
.It Sy ZPOOL_IMPORT_UDEV_TIMEOUT_MS
The maximum time in milliseconds that
.Nm zpool import
will wait for an expected device to be available.
.It Sy ZPOOL_STATUS_NON_NATIVE_ASHIFT_IGNORE
If set, suppress warning about non-native vdev ashift in
.Nm zpool status .
The value is not used, only the presence or absence of the variable matters.
.It Sy ZPOOL_VDEV_NAME_GUID
Cause
.Nm
subcommands to output vdev guids by default.
This behavior is identical to the
.Nm zpool Cm status Fl g
command line option.
.It Sy ZPOOL_VDEV_NAME_FOLLOW_LINKS
Cause
.Nm
subcommands to follow links for vdev names by default.
This behavior is identical to the
.Nm zpool Cm status Fl L
command line option.
.It Sy ZPOOL_VDEV_NAME_PATH
Cause
.Nm
subcommands to output full vdev path names by default.
This behavior is identical to the
.Nm zpool Cm status Fl P
command line option.
.It Sy ZFS_VDEV_DEVID_OPT_OUT
Older OpenZFS implementations had issues when attempting to display pool
config VDEV names if a
.Sy devid
NVP value is present in the pool's config.
.Pp
For example, a pool that originated on illumos platform would have a
.Sy devid
value in the config and
.Nm zpool status
would fail when listing the config.
This would also be true for future Linux-based pools.
.Pp
A pool can be stripped of any
.Sy devid
values on import or prevented from adding
them on
.Nm zpool Cm create
or
.Nm zpool Cm add
by setting
.Sy ZFS_VDEV_DEVID_OPT_OUT .
.Pp
.It Sy ZPOOL_SCRIPTS_AS_ROOT
Allow a privileged user to run
.Nm zpool status/iostat Fl c .
Normally, only unprivileged users are allowed to run
.Fl c .
.It Sy ZPOOL_SCRIPTS_PATH
The search path for scripts when running
.Nm zpool status/iostat Fl c .
This is a colon-separated list of directories and overrides the default
.Pa ~/.zpool.d
and
.Pa /etc/zfs/zpool.d
search paths.
.It Sy ZPOOL_SCRIPTS_ENABLED
Allow a user to run
.Nm zpool status/iostat Fl c .
If
.Sy ZPOOL_SCRIPTS_ENABLED
is not set, it is assumed that the user is allowed to run
.Nm zpool Cm status Ns / Ns Cm iostat Fl c .
