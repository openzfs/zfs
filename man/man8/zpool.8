.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBzpool\fR command configures \fBZFS\fR storage pools. A storage pool is a collection of devices that provides physical storage and data replication for \fBZFS\fR datasets.
.sp
.LP
All datasets within a storage pool share the same space. See \fBzfs\fR(8) for information on managing datasets.
.SS "Virtual Devices (\fBvdev\fRs)"
.sp
.LP
A "virtual device" describes a single device or a collection of devices organized according to certain performance and fault characteristics. The following virtual devices are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBdisk\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
A block device, typically located under \fB/dev\fR. \fBZFS\fR can use individual partitions, though the recommended mode of operation is to use whole disks. A disk can be specified by a full path, or it can be a shorthand name (the relative portion of the path under "/dev"). For example, "sda" is equivalent to "/dev/sda". A whole disk can be specified by omitting the partition designation. When given a whole disk, \fBZFS\fR automatically labels the disk, if necessary.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBfile\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
A regular file. The use of files as a backing store is strongly discouraged. It is designed primarily for experimental purposes, as the fault tolerance of a file is only as good as the file system of which it is a part. A file must be specified by a full path.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBmirror\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
A mirror of two or more devices. Data is replicated in an identical fashion across all components of a mirror. A mirror with \fIN\fR disks of size \fIX\fR can hold \fIX\fR bytes and can withstand (\fIN-1\fR) devices failing before data integrity is compromised.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBraidz\fR\fR
.ad
.br
.na
\fB\fBraidz1\fR\fR
.ad
.br
.na
\fB\fBraidz2\fR\fR
.ad
.br
.na
\fB\fBraidz3\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
A variation on \fBRAID-5\fR that allows for better distribution of parity and eliminates the "\fBRAID-5\fR write hole" (in which data and parity become inconsistent after a power loss). Data and parity is striped across all disks within a \fBraidz\fR group.
.sp
A \fBraidz\fR group can have single-, double- , or triple parity, meaning that the \fBraidz\fR group can sustain one, two, or three failures, respectively, without losing any data. The \fBraidz1\fR \fBvdev\fR type specifies a single-parity \fBraidz\fR group; the \fBraidz2\fR \fBvdev\fR type specifies a double-parity \fBraidz\fR group; and the \fBraidz3\fR \fBvdev\fR type specifies a triple-parity \fBraidz\fR group. The \fBraidz\fR \fBvdev\fR type is an alias for \fBraidz1\fR.
.sp
A \fBraidz\fR group with \fIN\fR disks of size \fIX\fR with \fIP\fR parity disks can hold approximately (\fIN-P\fR)*\fIX\fR bytes and can withstand \fIP\fR device(s) failing before data integrity is compromised. The minimum number of devices in a \fBraidz\fR group is one more than the number of parity disks. The recommended number is between 3 and 9 to help increase performance.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBspare\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
A special pseudo-\fBvdev\fR which keeps track of available hot spares for a pool. For more information, see the "Hot Spares" section.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBlog\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
A separate-intent log device. If more than one log device is specified, then writes are load-balanced between devices. Log devices can be mirrored. However, \fBraidz\fR \fBvdev\fR types are not supported for the intent log. For more information, see the "Intent Log" section.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBcache\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
A device used to cache storage pool data. A cache device cannot be configured as a mirror or \fBraidz\fR group. For more information, see the "Cache Devices" section.
.RE

.sp
.LP
Virtual devices cannot be nested, so a mirror or \fBraidz\fR virtual device can only contain files or disks. Mirrors of mirrors (or other combinations) are not allowed.
.sp
.LP
A pool can have any number of virtual devices at the top of the configuration (known as "root vdevs"). Data is dynamically distributed across all top-level devices to balance data among devices. As new virtual devices are added, \fBZFS\fR automatically places data on the newly available devices.
.sp
.LP
Virtual devices are specified one at a time on the command line, separated by whitespace. The keywords "mirror" and "raidz" are used to distinguish where a group ends and another begins. For example, the following creates two root vdevs, each a mirror of two disks:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBzpool create mypool mirror sda sdb mirror sdc sdd\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SS "Device Failure and Recovery"
.sp
.LP
\fBZFS\fR supports a rich set of mechanisms for handling device failure and data corruption. All metadata and data is checksummed, and \fBZFS\fR automatically repairs bad data from a good copy when corruption is detected.
.sp
.LP
In order to take advantage of these features, a pool must make use of some form of redundancy, using either mirrored or \fBraidz\fR groups. While \fBZFS\fR supports running in a non-redundant configuration, where each root vdev is simply a disk or file, this is strongly discouraged. A single case of bit corruption can render some or all of your data unavailable.
.sp
.LP
A pool's health status is described by one of three states: online, degraded, or faulted. An online pool has all devices operating normally. A degraded pool is one in which one or more devices have failed, but the data is still available due to a redundant configuration. A faulted pool has corrupted metadata, or one or more faulted devices, and insufficient replicas to continue functioning. 
.sp
.LP
The health of the top-level vdev, such as mirror or \fBraidz\fR device, is potentially impacted by the state of its associated vdevs, or component devices. A top-level vdev or component device is in one of the following states:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBDEGRADED\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
One or more top-level vdevs is in the degraded state because one or more component devices are offline. Sufficient replicas exist to continue functioning.
.sp
One or more component devices is in the degraded or faulted state, but sufficient replicas exist to continue functioning. The underlying conditions are as follows:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The number of checksum errors exceeds acceptable levels and the device is degraded as an indication that something may be wrong. \fBZFS\fR continues to use the device as necessary.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The number of I/O errors exceeds acceptable levels. The device could not be marked as faulted because there are insufficient replicas to continue functioning.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBFAULTED\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
One or more top-level vdevs is in the faulted state because one or more component devices are offline. Insufficient replicas exist to continue functioning. 
.sp
One or more component devices is in the faulted state, and insufficient replicas exist to continue functioning. The underlying conditions are as follows:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu

.RE

.sp
.LP
If a device is removed and later re-attached to the system, \fBZFS\fR attempts to put the device online automatically. Device attach detection is hardware-dependent and might not be supported on all platforms.
.SS "Hot Spares"
.sp
.LP
\fBZFS\fR allows devices to be associated with pools as "hot spares". These devices are not actively used in the pool, but when an active device fails, it is automatically replaced by a hot spare. To create a pool with hot spares, specify a "spare" \fBvdev\fR with any number of devices. For example, 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# zpool create pool mirror sda sdb spare sdc sdd
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Spares can be shared across multiple pools, and can be added with the "\fBzpool add\fR" command and removed with the "\fBzpool remove\fR" command. Once a spare replacement is initiated, a new "spare" \fBvdev\fR is created within the configuration that will remain there until the original device is replaced. At this point, the hot spare becomes available again.
.sp
.LP
If a pool has a shared spare that is currently being used, the pool can not be exported since other pools may use this shared spare, which may lead to potential data corruption.
.sp
.LP
An in-progress spare replacement can be cancelled by detaching the hot spare. If the original faulted device is detached, then the hot spare assumes its place in the configuration, and is removed from the spare list of all active pools.
.sp
.LP
Spares cannot replace log devices.
.SS "Intent Log"
.sp
.LP
The \fBZFS\fR Intent Log (\fBZIL\fR) satisfies \fBPOSIX\fR requirements for synchronous transactions. For instance, databases often require their transactions to be on stable storage devices when returning from a system call. \fBNFS\fR and other applications can also use \fBfsync\fR() to ensure data stability. By default, the intent log is allocated from blocks within the main pool. However, it might be possible to get better performance using separate intent log devices such as \fBNVRAM\fR or a dedicated disk. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fB# zpool create pool sda sdb log sdc\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Multiple log devices can also be specified, and they can be mirrored. See the EXAMPLES section for an example of mirroring multiple log devices.
.sp
.LP
Log devices can be added, replaced, attached, detached, and imported and exported as part of the larger pool. Mirrored log devices can be removed by specifying the top-level mirror for the log.
.SS "Cache Devices"
.sp
.LP
Devices can be added to a storage pool as "cache devices." These devices provide an additional layer of caching between main memory and disk. For read-heavy workloads, where the working set size is much larger than what can be cached in main memory, using cache devices allow much more of this working set to be served from low latency media. Using cache devices provides the greatest performance improvement for random read-workloads of mostly static content.
.sp
.LP
To create a pool with cache devices, specify a "cache" \fBvdev\fR with any number of devices. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fB# zpool create pool sda sdb cache sdc sdd\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Cache devices cannot be mirrored or part of a \fBraidz\fR configuration. If a read error is encountered on a cache device, that read \fBI/O\fR is reissued to the original storage pool device, which might be part of a mirrored or \fBraidz\fR configuration.
.sp
.LP
The content of the cache devices is considered volatile, as is the case with other system caches.
.SS "Properties"
.sp
.LP
Each pool has several properties associated with it. Some properties are read-only statistics while others are configurable and change the behavior of the pool. The following are read-only properties:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fBused\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Amount of storage space used within the pool.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The space usage properties report actual physical space available to the storage pool. The physical space can be different from the total amount of space that any contained datasets can actually use. The amount of space used in a \fBraidz\fR configuration depends on the characteristics of the data being written. In addition, \fBZFS\fR reserves some space for internal accounting that the \fBzfs\fR(8) command takes into account, but the \fBzpool\fR command does not. For non-full pools of a reasonable size, these effects should be invisible. For small pools, or pools that are close to being completely full, these discrepancies may become more noticeable.

.sp
.LP
The following property can be set at creation time:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBashift\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Pool sector size exponent, to the power of 2 (internally referred to as "ashift"). I/O operations will be aligned to the specified size boundaries. Additionally, the minimum (disk) write size will be set to the specified size, so this represents a space vs. performance trade-off. The typical case for setting this property is when performance is important and the underlying disks use 4KiB sectors but report 512B sectors to the OS (for compatibility reasons); in that case, set \fBashift=12\fR (which is 1<<12 = 4096).
.LP
For optimal performance, the pool sector size should be greater than or equal to the sector size of the underlying disks. Since the property cannot be changed after pool creation, if in a given pool, you \fIever\fR want to use drives that \fIreport\fR 4KiB sectors, you must set \fBashift=12\fR at pool creation time.
.LP
Keep in mind is that the \fBashift\fR is \fIvdev\fR specific and is not a \fIpool\fR global.  This means that when adding new vdevs to an existing pool you may need to specify the \fBashift\fR.

\fB\fBaltroot\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Alternate root directory. If set, this directory is prepended to any mount points within the pool. This can be used when examining an unknown pool where the mount points cannot be trusted, or in an alternate boot environment, where the typical paths are not valid. \fBaltroot\fR is not a persistent property. It is valid only while the system is up. Setting \fBaltroot\fR defaults to using \fBcachefile\fR=none, though this may be overridden using an explicit setting.

If set to \fBon\fR, the pool will be imported in read-only mode: Synchronous data in the intent log will not be accessible, properties of the pool can not be changed and datasets of the pool can only be mounted read-only.  The \fBreadonly\fR property of its datasets will be implicitly set to \fBon\fR.

It can also be specified by its column name of \fBrdonly\fR.

To write to a read-only pool, a export and import of the pool is required.

.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Controls automatic pool expansion when the underlying LUN is grown. If set to \fBon\fR, the pool will be resized according to the size of the expanded device. If the device is part of a mirror or \fBraidz\fR then all devices within that mirror/\fBraidz\fR group must be expanded before the new space is made available to the pool. The default behavior is \fBoff\fR. This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, \fBexpand\fR.

\fB\fBcachefile\fR=\fIpath\fR | \fBnone\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Controls the location of where the pool configuration is cached. Discovering all pools on system startup requires a cached copy of the configuration data that is stored on the root file system. All pools in this cache are automatically imported when the system boots. Some environments, such as install and clustering, need to cache this information in a different location so that pools are not automatically imported. Setting this property caches the pool configuration in a different location that can later be imported with "\fBzpool import -c\fR". Setting it to the special value "\fBnone\fR" creates a temporary pool that is never cached, and the special value \fB\&''\fR (empty string) uses the default location. 
.sp
Multiple pools can share the same cache file. Because the kernel destroys and recreates this file when pools are added and removed, care should be taken when attempting to access this file. When the last pool using a \fBcachefile\fR is exported or destroyed, the file is removed.

Creates a new storage pool containing the virtual devices specified on the command line. The pool name must begin with a letter, and can only contain alphanumeric characters as well as underscore ("_"), dash ("-"), period ("."), colon (":"), and space (" "). The pool names "mirror", "raidz", "spare" and "log" are reserved, as are names beginning with the pattern "c[0-9]". The \fBvdev\fR specification is described in the "Virtual Devices" section.
.sp
The command verifies that each device specified is accessible and not currently in use by another subsystem. There are some uses, such as being currently mounted, or specified as the dedicated dump device, that prevents a device from ever being used by \fBZFS\fR. Other uses, such as having a preexisting \fBUFS\fR file system, can be overridden with the \fB-f\fR option.
.sp
The command also checks that the replication strategy for the pool is consistent. An attempt to combine redundant and non-redundant storage in a single pool, or to mix disks and files, results in an error unless \fB-f\fR is specified. The use of differently sized devices within a single \fBraidz\fR or mirror group is also flagged as an error unless \fB-f\fR is specified.
.sp
Unless the \fB-R\fR option is specified, the default mount point is "/\fIpool\fR". The mount point must not exist or must be empty, or else the root dataset cannot be mounted. This can be overridden with the \fB-m\fR option.

\fB\fBzpool scrub\fR [\fB-s\fR] \fIpool\fR ...\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Begins a scrub. The scrub examines all data in the specified pools to verify that it checksums correctly. For replicated (mirror or \fBraidz\fR) devices, \fBZFS\fR automatically repairs any damage discovered during the scrub. The "\fBzpool status\fR" command reports the progress of the scrub and summarizes the results of the scrub upon completion.
.sp
Scrubbing and resilvering are very similar operations. The difference is that resilvering only examines data that \fBZFS\fR knows to be out of date (for example, when attaching a new device to a mirror or replacing an existing device), whereas scrubbing examines all data to discover silent errors due to hardware faults or disk failure.
.sp
Because scrubbing and resilvering are \fBI/O\fR-intensive operations, \fBZFS\fR only allows one at a time. If a scrub is already in progress, the "\fBzpool scrub\fR" command terminates it and starts a new scrub. If a resilver is in progress, \fBZFS\fR does not allow a scrub to be started until the resilver completes.
