.Sh NAME
.Nm fsck.zfs
.Nd dummy ZFS filesystem checker
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar options
.Ar dataset Ns No â€¦
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a thin shell wrapper that at most checks the status of a dataset's container pool.
It is installed by OpenZFS because some Linux
distributions expect a fsck helper for all filesystems.
.Pp
If more than one
.Ar dataset
is specified, each is checked in turn and the results binary-ored.
.
.Sh OPTIONS
Ignored.
.
.Sh NOTES
ZFS datasets are checked by running
.Nm zpool Cm scrub
on the containing pool.
An individual ZFS dataset is never checked independently of its pool,
which is unlike a regular filesystem.
.Pp
However, the
.Xr fsck 8
interface still allows it to communicate some errors: if the
.Ar dataset
is in a degraded pool, then
.Nm
will return exit code
.Sy 4
to indicate an uncorrected filesystem error.
.Pp
Similarly, if the
.Ar dataset
is in a faulted pool and has a legacy
.Pa /etc/fstab
record, then
.Nm
will return exit code
.Sy 8
to indicate a fatal operational error.
