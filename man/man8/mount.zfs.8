.TH mount.zfs 8 "2013 FEB 28" "ZFS on Linux" "System Administration Commands"

.SH NAME
mount.zfs \- mount a ZFS filesystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.BI "mount.zfs [\-sfnvh] [\-o " options "]" " dataset mountpoint

.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR mount.zfs
is part of the zfsutils package for Linux. It is a helper program that
is usually invoked by the
.BR mount (8)
or
.BR zfs (8)
commands to mount a ZFS dataset.

All
.I options
are handled according to the FILESYSTEM INDEPENDENT MOUNT OPTIONS
section in the
.BR mount (8)
manual, except for those described below.

The
.I dataset
parameter is a ZFS filesystem name, as output by the
.B "zfs list -H -o name
command. This parameter never has a leading slash character and is
not a device name.

The
.I mountpoint
parameter is the path name of a directory.


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-s"
Ignore bad or sloppy mount options.
.TP
.BI "\-f"
Do a fake mount; do not perform the mount operation.
.TP
.BI "\-n"
Do not update the /etc/mtab file.
.TP
.BI "\-v"
Increase verbosity.
.TP
.BI "\-h"
Print the usage message.
.TP
.BI "\-o context"
This flag sets the SELinux context for all files in the filesytem
under that mountpoint.
.TP
.BI "\-o fscontext"
This flag sets the SELinux context for the filesytem being mounted.
.TP
.BI "\-o defcontext"
This flag sets the SELinux context for unlabled files.
.TP
.BI "\-o rootcontext"
This flag sets the SELinux context for the root inode of the filesystem.
.TP
.BI "\-o legacy"
This private flag indicates that the
.I dataset
has an entry in the /etc/fstab file.
.TP
.BI "\-o noxattr"
This private flag disables extended attributes.
.TP
.BI "\-o xattr
This private flag enables extended attributes and, if appropriate,
adds a ZFS context to the selinux system policy.
.TP
.BI "\-o zfsutil"
This private flag indicates that
.BR mount (8)
is being called by the
.BR zfs (8)
command.

.SH NOTES
ZFS conventionally requires that the
.I mountpoint
be an empty directory, but the Linux implementation inconsistently
enforces the requirement.

The
.BR mount.zfs
helper does not mount the contents of zvols.

.SH FILES
.TP 18n
.I /etc/fstab
The static filesystem table.
.TP
.I /etc/mtab
The mounted filesystem table.
.SH "AUTHORS"
The primary author of
.BR mount.zfs
is Brian Behlendorf <behlendorf1@llnl.gov>.

This man page was written by Darik Horn <dajhorn@vanadac.com>.
