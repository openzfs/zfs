.Sh NAME
.Nm zpool-export
.Nd export ZFS storage pools
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm zpool
.Cm export
.Op Fl f
.Fl a Ns | Ns Ar pool Ns â€¦
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Exports the given pools from the system.
All devices are marked as exported, but are still considered in use by other
subsystems.
The devices can be moved between systems
.Pq even those of different endianness
and imported as long as a sufficient number of devices are present.
.Pp
Before exporting the pool, all datasets within the pool are unmounted.
A pool can not be exported if it has a shared spare that is currently being
used.
.Pp
For pools to be portable, you must give the
.Nm zpool
command whole disks, not just partitions, so that ZFS can label the disks with
portable EFI labels.
Otherwise, disk drivers on platforms of different endianness will not recognize
the disks.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Exports all pools imported on the system.
.It Fl f
Forcefully unmount all datasets, and allow export of pools with active shared spares.
.Pp
This command will forcefully export the pool even if it has a shared spare that
is currently being used.
This may lead to potential data corruption.
