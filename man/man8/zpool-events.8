.Sh NAME
.Nm zpool-events
.Nd list recent events generated by kernel
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm zpool
.Cm events
.Op Fl vHf
.Op Ar pool
.Nm zpool
.Cm events
.Fl c
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Lists all recent events generated by the ZFS kernel modules.
These events are consumed by the
.Xr zed 8
and used to automate administrative tasks such as replacing a failed device
with a hot spare.
For more information about the subclasses and event payloads
that can be generated see
.Sx EVENTS
and the following sections.
.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -compact -width Ds
.It Fl c
Clear all previous events.
.It Fl f
Follow mode.
.It Fl H
Scripted mode.
Do not display headers, and separate fields by a
single tab instead of arbitrary space.
.It Fl v
Print the entire payload for each event.
.El
.
.Sh EVENTS
These are the different event subclasses.
The full event name would be
.Sy ereport.fs.zfs.\& Ns Em SUBCLASS ,
but only the last part is listed here.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width "vdev.bad_guid_sum"
.It Sy checksum
Issued when a checksum error has been detected.
.It Sy io
Issued when there is an I/O error in a vdev in the pool.
.It Sy data
Issued when there have been data errors in the pool.
.It Sy deadman
Issued when an I/O request is determined to be "hung", this can be caused
by lost completion events due to flaky hardware or drivers.
See
.Sy zfs_deadman_failmode
in
.Xr zfs 4
for additional information regarding "hung" I/O detection and configuration.
.It Sy delay
Issued when a completed I/O request exceeds the maximum allowed time
specified by the

module parameter.
This can be an indicator of problems with the underlying storage device.
The number of delay events is ratelimited by the
.Sy zfs_slow_io_events_per_second
module parameter.
.It Sy dio_verify_rd
Issued when there was a checksum verify error after a Direct I/O read has been
issued.
.It Sy dio_verify_wr
Issued when there was a checksum verify error after a Direct I/O write has been
issued.
This event can only take place if the module parameter
.Sy zfs_vdev_direct_write_verify
is not set to zero.
See
.Xr zfs 4
for more details on the
.Sy zfs_vdev_direct_write_verify
module paramter.
.It Sy config
Issued every time a vdev change have been done to the pool.
.It Sy zpool
Issued when a pool cannot be imported.
.It Sy zpool.destroy
Issued when a pool is destroyed.
.It Sy zpool.export
Issued when a pool is exported.

.It Sy vdev.bad_guid_sum
Issued when a missing device in the pool have been detected.
.It Sy vdev.too_small
Issued when the system (kernel) have removed a device, and ZFS
notices that the device isn't there any more.
This is usually followed by a
.Sy probe_failure
event.

have been kicked from the system outside of ZFS (such as the kernel
have removed the device).
.It Sy log_replay

and can include some gaps of non-corruption.
(See

.It Sy bad_ranges_min_gap
In order to bound the size of the
.Sy bad_ranges
array, gaps of non-corruption
less than or equal to

bytes have been merged with
adjacent corruption.
Always at least 8 bytes, since corruption is detected on a 64-bit word basis.
.It Sy bad_range_sets

Each element contains
the count of bits in that range which were clear in the good data and set

.Sy bad_ranges .
Each element contains
the count of bits for that range which were set in the good data and clear in
the bad data.
.It Sy bad_set_bits
If this field exists, it is an array of
.Pq Ar bad data No & ~( Ns Ar good data ) ;
that is, the bits set in the bad data which are cleared in the good data.
Each element corresponds a byte whose offset is in a range in
.Sy bad_ranges ,
and the array is ordered by offset.
Thus, the first element is the first byte in the first
.Sy bad_ranges
range, and the last element is the last byte in the last
.Sy bad_ranges
range.
.It Sy bad_cleared_bits
Like
.Sy bad_set_bits ,
but contains
.Pq Ar good data No & ~( Ns Ar bad data ) ;
that is, the bits set in the good data which are cleared in the bad data.
.El
.
.Sh I/O STAGES
The ZFS I/O pipeline is comprised of various stages which are defined below.
The individual stages are used to construct these basic I/O
operations: Read, Write, Free, Claim, Flush and Trim.
These stages may be
set on an event to describe the life cycle of a given I/O request.
