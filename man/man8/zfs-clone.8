.Op Fl p
.Oo Fl o Ar property Ns = Ns Ar value Oc Ns â€¦
.Ar snapshot Ar filesystem Ns | Ns Ar volume
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
See the
.Sx Clones
section of
.Xr zfsconcepts 7
for details.
The target dataset can be located anywhere in the ZFS hierarchy,
and is created as the same type as the original.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl o Ar property Ns = Ns Ar value
Sets the specified property; see
.Nm zfs Cm create
for details.
.It Fl p

Datasets created in this manner are automatically mounted according to the
.Sy mountpoint
property inherited from their parent.
If the target filesystem or volume already exists, the operation completes
successfully.

.Sh EXAMPLES
.\" These are, respectively, examples 9, 10 from zfs.8
.\" Make sure to update them bidirectionally
.Ss Example 1 : No Creating a ZFS Clone
The following command creates a writable file system whose initial contents are
the same as
.Ar pool/home/bob@yesterday .
.Dl # Nm zfs Cm clone Ar pool/home/bob@yesterday pool/clone
.
.Ss Example 2 : No Promoting a ZFS Clone
The following commands illustrate how to test out changes to a file system, and
then replace the original file system with the changed one, using clones, clone
promotion, and renaming:
.Bd -literal -compact -offset Ds
.No # Nm zfs Cm create Ar pool/project/production
  populate /pool/project/production with data
.No # Nm zfs Cm snapshot Ar pool/project/production Ns @ Ns Ar today
.No # Nm zfs Cm clone Ar pool/project/production@today pool/project/beta
  make changes to /pool/project/beta and test them
.No # Nm zfs Cm promote Ar pool/project/beta
.No # Nm zfs Cm rename Ar pool/project/production pool/project/legacy
.No # Nm zfs Cm rename Ar pool/project/beta pool/project/production
  once the legacy version is no longer needed, it can be destroyed
.No # Nm zfs Cm destroy Ar pool/project/legacy
