.Os
.
.Sh NAME
.Nm zfs-zone ,
.Nm zfs-unzone
.Nd attach and detach ZFS filesystems to user namespaces
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm zfs Cm zone
.Ar nsfile
.Ar filesystem
.Nm zfs Cm unzone
.Ar nsfile
.Ar filesystem
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bl -tag -width ""
.It Xo
.Nm zfs
.Cm zone
.Ar nsfile
.Ar filesystem
.Xc
Attach the specified
.Ar filesystem
to the user namespace identified by
.Ar nsfile .
From now on this file system tree can be managed from within a user namespace
if the
.Sy zoned
property has been set.
.Pp
You cannot attach a zoned dataset's children to another user namespace.
You can also not attach the root file system
of the user namespace or any dataset
which needs to be mounted before the zfs service
is run inside the user namespace,
as it would be attached unmounted until it is
mounted from the service inside the user namespace.
.Pp
To allow management of the dataset from within a user namespace, the
.Sy zoned
property has to be set and the user namespaces needs access to the
.Pa /dev/zfs
device.
The
.Sy quota
property cannot be changed from within a user namespace.
.Pp
After a dataset is attached to a user namespace and the
.Sy zoned
property is set,
a zoned file system cannot be mounted outside the user namespace,
since the user namespace administrator might have set the mount point
to an unacceptable value.
.It Xo
.Nm zfs
.Cm unzone
.Ar nsfile
.Ar filesystem
.Xc
Detach the specified
.Ar filesystem
from the user namespace identified by
.Ar nsfile .

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Ss Example 1 : No Delegating a Dataset to a User Namespace
The following example delegates the
.Ar tank/users
dataset to a user namespace identified by user namespace file
.Pa /proc/1234/ns/user .
.Dl # Nm zfs Cm zone Ar /proc/1234/ns/user Ar tank/users
