.Sh NAME
.Nm zpool-attach
.Nd attach new device to existing ZFS vdev
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm zpool
.Cm attach
.Op Fl fsw
.Oo Fl o Ar property Ns = Ns Ar value Oc
.Ar pool device new_device
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Attaches
.Ar new_device
to the existing
.Ar device .
The existing device cannot be part of a raidz configuration.
If
.Ar device
is not currently part of a mirrored configuration,
.Ar device
automatically transforms into a two-way mirror of
.Ar device
and
.Ar new_device .
If
.Ar device
is part of a two-way mirror, attaching
.Ar new_device
creates a three-way mirror, and so on.
In either case,
.Ar new_device
begins to resilver immediately and any running scrub is cancelled.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f
Forces use of
.Ar new_device ,
even if it appears to be in use.
Not all devices can be overridden in this manner.
.It Fl o Ar property Ns = Ns Ar value
Sets the given pool properties.
See the
.Xr zpoolprops 7
manual page for a list of valid properties that can be set.
The only property supported at the moment is
.Sy ashift .
.It Fl s
The
.Ar new_device
is reconstructed sequentially to restore redundancy as quickly as possible.
Checksums are not verified during sequential reconstruction so a scrub is
started when the resilver completes.
Sequential reconstruction is not supported for raidz configurations.
.It Fl w
Waits until
.Ar new_device
has finished resilvering before returning.
