.Nd Condense, flush, garbage collect or otherwise clean up pool metadata
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm zpool
.Cm condense
.Fl t Ar target
.Op Fl c | w
.Ar pool
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Many internal pool metadata updates are performed in the background at a rate
chosen to limit the performance impact to normal use of the pool.
Sometimes it is desirable to accelerate these operations,
even if it affects overall performance.
.Sy condense
allows an operator to request that a specific background operation be
prioritised to complete as soon as possible.
.Pp
These are the possible values for
.Ar target :
.Bl -tag -compact -offset Ds -width "log-spacemap"
.It Sy log-spacemap
flushing log spacemap entries to their underlying metaslabs
.El
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Cancel a previous
.Sy condense .
This will return background updates to their normal rate.
.It Fl w
Wait until the condense has completed before returning.
