Renames the given dataset.
The new target can be located anywhere in the ZFS hierarchy, with the exception
of snapshots.
Snapshots can only be renamed within the parent file system or volume.
When renaming a snapshot, the parent file system of the snapshot does not need
to be specified as part of the second argument.
Renamed file systems can inherit new mount points, in which case they are
unmounted and remounted at the new mount point.
.Bl -tag -width "-a"
.It Fl f
Force unmount any file systems that need to be unmounted in the process.
This flag has no effect if used together with the
.Fl u
flag.
.It Fl p
Creates all the nonexistent parent datasets.
Datasets created in this manner are automatically mounted according to the
.Sy mountpoint
property inherited from their parent.
.It Fl u
Do not remount file systems during rename.
If a file system's
.Sy mountpoint
property is set to
.Sy legacy
or
.Sy none ,
the file system is not unmounted even if this option is not given.

Recursively rename the snapshots of all descendent datasets.
Snapshots are the only dataset that can be renamed recursively.
