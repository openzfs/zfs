.Dt ZPOOL-REPLACE 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm zpool Ns Pf - Cm replace
.Nd Replace one device with another in a ZFS storage pool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Cm replace
.Op Fl fsw
.Oo Fl o Ar property Ns = Ns Ar value Oc
.Ar pool Ar device Op Ar new_device
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Nm
.Cm replace
.Op Fl fsw
.Op Fl o Ar property Ns = Ns Ar value
.Ar pool Ar device Op Ar new_device
.Xc
Replaces
.Ar old_device
with
.Ar new_device .
This is equivalent to attaching
.Ar new_device ,
waiting for it to resilver, and then detaching
.Ar old_device .
Any in progress scrub will be cancelled.
.Pp
The size of
.Ar new_device
must be greater than or equal to the minimum size of all the devices in a mirror
or raidz configuration.
.Pp
.Ar new_device
is required if the pool is not redundant.
If
.Ar new_device
is not specified, it defaults to
.Ar old_device .
This form of replacement is useful after an existing disk has failed and has
been physically replaced.
In this case, the new disk may have the same
.Pa /dev
path as the old device, even though it is actually a different disk.
ZFS recognizes this.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f
Forces use of
.Ar new_device ,
even if it appears to be in use.
Not all devices can be overridden in this manner.
.It Fl o Ar property Ns = Ns Ar value
Sets the given pool properties. See the
.Xr zpoolprops
manual page for a list of valid properties that can be set.
The only property supported at the moment is
.Sy ashift .
.It Fl s
The
.Ar new_device
is reconstructed sequentially to restore redundancy as quickly as possible.
Checksums are not verfied during sequential reconstruction so a scrub is
started when the resilver completes.
Sequential reconstruction is not supported for raidz configurations.
.It Fl w
Waits until the replacement has completed before returning.
