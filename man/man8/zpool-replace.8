.Sh NAME
.Nm zpool-replace
.Nd replace one device with another in ZFS storage pool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm zpool
.Cm replace
.Op Fl fsw
.Oo Fl o Ar property Ns = Ns Ar value Oc
.Ar pool Ar device Op Ar new-device
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Replaces
.Ar device
with
.Ar new-device .
This is equivalent to attaching
.Ar new-device ,
waiting for it to resilver, and then detaching
.Ar device .
Any in progress scrub will be cancelled.
.Pp
The size of
.Ar new-device
must be greater than or equal to the minimum size of all the devices in a mirror
or raidz configuration.
.Pp
.Ar new-device
is required if the pool is not redundant.
If
.Ar new-device
is not specified, it defaults to
.Ar device .
This form of replacement is useful after an existing disk has failed and has
been physically replaced.
In this case, the new disk may have the same
.Pa /dev
path as the old device, even though it is actually a different disk.
ZFS recognizes this.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f
Forces use of
.Ar new-device ,
even if it appears to be in use.
Not all devices can be overridden in this manner.
.It Fl o Ar property Ns = Ns Ar value
Sets the given pool properties.
See the
.Xr zpoolprops 7
manual page for a list of valid properties that can be set.
The only property supported at the moment is
.Sy ashift .
.It Fl s
The
.Ar new-device
is reconstructed sequentially to restore redundancy as quickly as possible.
Checksums are not verified during sequential reconstruction so a scrub is
started when the resilver completes.
Sequential reconstruction is not supported for raidz configurations.
.It Fl w
Waits until the replacement has completed before returning.
