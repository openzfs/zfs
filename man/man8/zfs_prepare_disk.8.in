.Sh NAME
.Nm zfs_prepare_disk
.Nd special script that gets run before bringing a disk into a pool
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an optional script that gets called by libzfs before bringing a disk into a
pool.
It can be modified by the user to run whatever commands are necessary to prepare
a disk for inclusion into the pool.
For example, users can add lines to
.Nm zfs_prepare_disk
to do things like update the drive's firmware or check the drive's health.
.Nm zfs_prepare_disk
is optional and can be removed if not needed.
libzfs will look for the script at @zfsexecdir@/zfs_prepare_disk.
.
.Ss Properties
.Nm zfs_prepare_disk
will be passed the following environment variables:
.sp
.Bl -tag -compact -width "VDEV_ENC_SYSFS_PATH"
.
.It Nm POOL_NAME
.No Name of the pool
.It Nm VDEV_PATH
.No Path to the disk (like /dev/sda)
.It Nm VDEV_PREPARE
.No Reason why the disk is being prepared for inclusion
('create', 'add', 'replace', or 'autoreplace').
This can be useful if you only want the script to be run under certain actions.
.It Nm VDEV_UPATH
.No Path to one of the underlying devices for the
disk.
For multipath this would return one of the /dev/sd* paths to the disk.
If the device is not a device mapper device, then
.Nm VDEV_UPATH
just returns the same value as
.Nm VDEV_PATH
.It Nm VDEV_ENC_SYSFS_PATH
.No Path to the disk's enclosure sysfs path, if available
.El
.Pp
Note that some of these variables may have a blank value.
.Nm POOL_NAME
is blank at pool creation time, for example.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm zfs_prepare_disk
runs with a limited $PATH.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm zfs_prepare_disk
should return 0 on success, non-zero otherwise.
If non-zero is returned, the disk will not be included in the pool.
