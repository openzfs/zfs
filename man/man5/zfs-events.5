.TH ZFS-EVENTS 5 "Jun 6, 2015"
.SH NAME
zfs\-events \- Events created by the ZFS filesystem.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Description of the different events generated by the ZFS stack.
.sp
Most of these don't have any description. The events generated by ZFS
have never been publicly documented.  What is here is intended as a
starting point to provide documentation for all possible events.
.sp
To view all events created since the loading of the ZFS infrastructure
(i.e, "the module"), run
.P
.nf
\fBzpool events\fR
.fi
.P
to get a short list, and
.P
.nf
\fBzpool events -v\fR
.fi
.P
to get a full detail of the events and what information
is available about it.
.sp
This man page lists the different subclasses that are issued
in the case of an event. The full event name would be
\fIereport.fs.zfs.SUBCLASS\fR, but we only list the last
part here.

The ZFS I/O pipeline is comprised of various stages which are defined
