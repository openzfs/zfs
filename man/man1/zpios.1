.SH NAME
zpios \- Directly test the DMU.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.BI "zpios [options] <\-p " pool ">"

.SH DESCRIPTION
This utility runs in-kernel DMU performance and stress tests that do
not depend on the ZFS Posix Layer ("ZPL").

.SH OPTIONS
.HP
.BI "\-s" " regex" ", \-\-threadcount" " regex"
.IP
Start this many threads for each test series, specified as a comma
delimited regular expression. (eg: "-s 1,2,3")
.IP
This option is mutually exclusive with the \fBthreadcount_*\fR
options.
.HP
.BI "\-l" " regex_low" ", \-\-threadcount_low" " regex_low"
.HP
.BI "\-h" " regex_high" ", \-\-threadcount_high" " regex_high"
.HP
.BI "\-e" " regex_incr" ", \-\-threadcount_incr" " regex_incr"
.IP
Start \fIregex_low\fR threads for the first test,
add \fIregex_incr\fR threads for each subsequent test,
and start \fIregex_high\fR threads for the last test.
.IP
These three options must be specified together and are mutually
exclusive with the \fBthreadcount\fR option.
.HP
.BI "\-n" " regex" ", \-\-regioncount" " regex"
.IP
Create this many regions for each test series, specified as a comma
delimited regular expression. (eg: "-n 512,4096,65536")
.IP
This option is mutually exclusive with the \fBregioncount_*\fR
options.
.HP
.BI "\-i" " regex_low" ", \-\-regioncount_low" " regex_low"
.HP
.BI "\-j" " regex_high" ", \-\-regioncount_high" " regex_high"
.HP
.BI "\-k" " regex_incr" ", \-\-regioncount_incr" " regex_incr"
.IP
Create \fIregex_low\fR regions for the first test,
add \fIregex_incr\fR regions for each subsequent test, and
create \fIregex_high\fR regions for the last test.
.IP
These three options must be specified together and are mutually
exclusive with the \fBregioncount\fR option.
.HP
.BI "\-o" " size" ", \-\-offset" " size"
.IP
Create regions at \fIsize\fR offset for each test series, specified as
a comma delimited regular expression with an optional unit suffix.
(eg: "-o 4M" means four megabytes.)
.IP
This option is mutually exclusive with the \fBoffset_*\fR options.
.HP
.BI "\-m" " size_low" ", \-\-offset_low" " size_low"
.HP
.BI "\-q" " size_high" ", \-\-offset_high" " size_high"
.HP
.BI "\-r" " size_incr" ", \-\-offset_incr" " size_incr"
.IP
Create a region at \fIsize_low\fR offset for the first test, add
\fIsize_incr\fR to the offset for each subsequent test, and create
a region at \fIsize_high\fR offset for the last test.
.IP
These three options must be specified together and are mutually
exclusive with the \fBoffset\fR option.
.HP
.BI "\-c" " size" ", \-\-chunksize" " size"
.IP
Use \fIsize\fR chunks for each test, specified as a comma delimited
regular expression with an optional unit suffix. (eg: "-c 1M" means
one megabyte.) The chunk size must be at least the region size.
.IP
This option is mutually exclusive with the \fBchunksize_*\fB options.
.HP
.BI "\-a" " size_low" ", \-\-chunksize_low" " size_low"
.HP
.BI "\-b" " size_high" ", \-\-chunksize_high" " size_high"
.HP
.BI "\-g" " size_incr" ", \-\-chunksize_incr" " size_incr"
.IP
Use a \fIsize_low\fR chunk size for the first test, add \fIsize_incr\fR
to the chunk size for each subsequent test, and use a \fIsize_high\fR
chunk size for the last test.
.IP
These three options must be specified together and are mutually
exclusive with the \fBchunksize\fR option.
.HP
.BI "\-L" " dmu_flags" ", \-\-load" " dmu_flags"
.IP
Specify \fIdmuio\fR for regular DMU_IO, \fIssf\fR for single shared
file access, or \fIfpp\fR for per thread access. Use commas to delimit
multiple flags. (eg: "-L dmuio,ssf")
.HP
.BI "\-p" " name" ", \-\-pool" " name"
.IP
The pool name, which is mandatory.
.HP
.BI "\-M" " test" ", \-\-name" " test"
.IP
An arbitrary string that appears in the program output.
.HP
.BI "-x, \-\-cleanup"
.IP
Enable the DMU_REMOVE flag.
.HP
.BI "\-P" " command" ", \-\-prerun" " command"
.IP
Invoke \fIcommand\fR from the kernel before running the test. Shell
expansion is not performed and the environment is set to
HOME=/; TERM=linux; PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin.
.HP
.BI "\-R" " command" ", \-\-postrun" " command"
.IP
Invoke \fIcommand\fR from the kernel after running the test. Shell
expansion is not performed and the environment is set to
HOME=/; TERM=linux; PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin.
.HP
.BI "\-G" " directory" ", \-\-log" " directory"
.IP
