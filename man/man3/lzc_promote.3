.SH PROLOG
This manual page is part of the OpenZFS Programmer's Manual.

.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <libzfs_core.h>

\fBint\fR \fBlzc_promote\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIfsname\fR, \fBnvlist_t *\fR\fIopts\fR, \fBnvlist_t **\fR\fIoutnvl\fR);

.SH NAME
lzc_promote \- Reverse clone parent-child relationship

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBlzc_promote\fR() function promotes a clone file system \fIfsname\fR to
no longer be dependent on its "origin" snapshot. This makes it possible to
destroy the file system from which the clone was created. The clone
parent-child dependency relationship is reversed, so that the origin file
system becomes a clone of the specified file system.

The snapshot that was cloned, and any snapshots previous to this snapshot, are
now owned by the promoted clone. The space they use moves from the origin file
system to the promoted clone, so enough space must be available to accom‚Äê
modate these snapshots. No new space is consumed by this operation, but the
space accounting is adjusted. The promoted clone must not have any conflicting
snapshot names of its own. The rename subcommand can be used to rename  any
conflicting snapshots.

The nvlist \fIopts\fR is reserved for future extensions that provide options
that alter the behavior of the lzc_promote() function. At the time of writing,
all data passed to it is ignored and callers should pass NULL to ensure that
behavior remains the same with future extensions.

The nvlist handle \fIoutnvl\fR is updated with a nvlist containing information
from the kernel when non-NULL. At present, a \fIconflsnap\fR string is provided
when a conflicting snapshot triggers EEXIST while a \fIparent\fR string is
provided on either success or a conflicting snapshot.

.SH RETURN VALUES

Upon successful completion, 0 is returned. Otherwise, an error is returned.
