/*
 * kstat structure and locking strategy
 *
 * Each kstat consists of a header section (a kstat_t) and a data section.
 * The system maintains a set of kstats, protected by kstat_chain_lock.
 * kstat_chain_lock protects all additions to/deletions from this set,
 * as well as all changes to kstat headers.  kstat data sections are
 * *optionally* protected by the per-kstat ks_lock.  If ks_lock is non-NULL,
 * kstat clients (e.g. /dev/kstat) will acquire this lock for all of their
 * operations on that kstat.  It is up to the kstat provider to decide whether
 * guaranteeing consistent data to kstat clients is sufficiently important
 * to justify the locking cost.  Note, however, that most statistic updates
 * already occur under one of the provider's mutexes, so if the provider sets
 * ks_lock to point to that mutex, then kstat data locking is free.
 *
 * NOTE: variable-size kstats MUST employ kstat data locking, to prevent
 * data-size races with kstat clients.
 *
 * NOTE: ks_lock is really of type (kmutex_t *); it is declared as (void *)
 * in the kstat header so that users don't have to be exposed to all of the
 * kernel's lock-related data structures.

/*

 *
 * Any of the following flags may be passed to kstat_create().  They are
 * all zero by default.
 *
 *	KSTAT_FLAG_VIRTUAL:
 *
 *		Tells kstat_create() not to allocate memory for the
 *		kstat data section; instead, you will set the ks_data
 *		field to point to the data you wish to export.  This
 *		provides a convenient way to export existing data
 *		structures.
 *
 *	KSTAT_FLAG_VAR_SIZE:
 *
 *		The size of the kstat you are creating will vary over time.
 *		For example, you may want to use the kstat mechanism to
 *		export a linked list.  NOTE: The kstat framework does not
 *		manage the data section, so all variable-size kstats must be
 *		virtual kstats.  Moreover, variable-size kstats MUST employ
 *		kstat data locking to prevent data-size races with kstat
 *		clients.  See the section on "kstat snapshot" for details.
 *
 *	KSTAT_FLAG_WRITABLE:
 *
 *		Makes the kstat's data section writable by root.
 *		The ks_snapshot routine (see below) does not need to check for
 *		this; permission checking is handled in the kstat driver.
 *
 *	KSTAT_FLAG_PERSISTENT:
 *
 *		Indicates that this kstat is to be persistent over time.
 *		For persistent kstats, kstat_delete() simply marks the
 *		kstat as dormant; a subsequent kstat_create() reactivates
 *		the kstat.  This feature is provided so that statistics
 *		are not lost across driver close/open (e.g., raw disk I/O
 *		on a disk with no mounted partitions.)
 *		NOTE: Persistent kstats cannot be virtual, since ks_data
 *		points to garbage as soon as the driver goes away.
 *
 * The following flags are maintained by the kstat framework:
 *
 *	KSTAT_FLAG_DORMANT:
 *
 *		For persistent kstats, indicates that the kstat is in the
 *		dormant state (e.g., the corresponding device is closed).
 *
 *	KSTAT_FLAG_INVALID:
 *
 *		This flag is set when a kstat is in a transitional state,
 *		e.g. between kstat_create() and kstat_install().
 *		kstat clients must not attempt to access the kstat's data
 *		if this flag is set.

/*
 * Dynamic update support
 *
 * The kstat mechanism allows for an optional ks_update function to update
 * kstat data.  This is useful for drivers where the underlying device
 * keeps cheap hardware stats, but extraction is expensive.  Instead of
 * constantly keeping the kstat data section up to date, you can supply a
 * ks_update function which updates the kstat's data section on demand.
 * To take advantage of this feature, simply set the ks_update field before
 * calling kstat_install().
 *
 * The ks_update function, if supplied, must have the following structure:
 *
 *	int
 *	foo_kstat_update(kstat_t *ksp, int rw)
 *	{
 *		if (rw == KSTAT_WRITE) {
 *			... update the native stats from ksp->ks_data;
 *				return EACCES if you don't support this
 *		} else {
 *			... update ksp->ks_data from the native stats
 *		}
 *	}
 *
 * The ks_update return codes are: 0 for success, EACCES if you don't allow
 * KSTAT_WRITE, and EIO for any other type of error.
 *
 * In general, the ks_update function may need to refer to provider-private
 * data; for example, it may need a pointer to the provider's raw statistics.
 * The ks_private field is available for this purpose.  Its use is entirely
 * at the provider's discretion.
 *
 * All variable-size kstats MUST supply a ks_update routine, which computes
 * and sets ks_data_size (and ks_ndata if that is meaningful), since these
 * are needed to perform kstat snapshots (see below).
 *
 * No kstat locking should be done inside the ks_update routine.  The caller
 * will already be holding the kstat's ks_lock (to ensure consistent data).
 */

#define	KSTAT_READ	0
#define	KSTAT_WRITE	1

/*
 * Kstat snapshot
 *
 * In order to get a consistent view of a kstat's data, clients must obey
 * the kstat's locking strategy.  However, these clients may need to perform
 * operations on the data which could cause a fault (e.g. copyout()), or
 * operations which are simply expensive.  Doing so could cause deadlock
 * (e.g. if you're holding a disk's kstat lock which is ultimately required
 * to resolve a copyout() fault), performance degradation (since the providers'
 * activity is serialized at the kstat lock), device timing problems, etc.
 *
 * To avoid these problems, kstat data is provided via snapshots.  Taking
 * a snapshot is a simple process: allocate a wired-down kernel buffer,
 * acquire the kstat's data lock, copy the data into the buffer ("take the
 * snapshot"), and release the lock.  This ensures that the kstat's data lock
 * will be held as briefly as possible, and that no faults will occur while
 * the lock is held.
 *
 * Normally, the snapshot is taken by default_kstat_snapshot(), which
 * timestamps the data (sets ks_snaptime), copies it, and does a little
 * massaging to deal with incomplete transactions on i/o kstats.  However,
 * this routine only works for kstats with contiguous data (the typical case).
 * If you create a kstat whose data is, say, a linked list, you must provide
 * your own ks_snapshot routine.  The routine you supply must have the
 * following prototype (replace "foo" with something appropriate):
 *
 *	int foo_kstat_snapshot(kstat_t *ksp, void *buf, int rw);
 *
 * The minimal snapshot routine -- one which copies contiguous data that
 * doesn't need any massaging -- would be this:
 *
 *	ksp->ks_snaptime = gethrtime();
 *	if (rw == KSTAT_WRITE)
 *		bcopy(buf, ksp->ks_data, ksp->ks_data_size);
 *	else
 *		bcopy(ksp->ks_data, buf, ksp->ks_data_size);
 *	return (0);
 *
 * A more illuminating example is taking a snapshot of a linked list:
 *
 *	ksp->ks_snaptime = gethrtime();
 *	if (rw == KSTAT_WRITE)
 *		return (EACCES);		... See below ...
 *	for (foo = first_foo; foo; foo = foo->next) {
 *		bcopy((char *) foo, (char *) buf, sizeof (struct foo));
 *		buf = ((struct foo *) buf) + 1;
 *	}
 *	return (0);
 *
 * In the example above, we have decided that we don't want to allow
 * KSTAT_WRITE access, so we return EACCES if this is attempted.
 *
 * The key points are:
 *
 *	(1) ks_snaptime must be set (via gethrtime()) to timestamp the data.
 *	(2) Data gets copied from the kstat to the buffer on KSTAT_READ,
 *		and from the buffer to the kstat on KSTAT_WRITE.
 *	(3) ks_snapshot return values are: 0 for success, EACCES if you
 *		don't allow KSTAT_WRITE, and EIO for any other type of error.
 *
 * Named kstats (see section on "Named statistics" below) containing long
 * strings (KSTAT_DATA_STRING) need special handling.  The kstat driver
 * assumes that all strings are copied into the buffer after the array of
 * named kstats, and the pointers (KSTAT_NAMED_STR_PTR()) are updated to point
 * into the copy within the buffer. The default snapshot routine does this,
 * but overriding routines should contain at least the following:
 *
 * if (rw == KSTAT_READ) {
 * 	kstat_named_t *knp = buf;
 * 	char *end = knp + ksp->ks_ndata;
 * 	uint_t i;
 *
 * 	... Do the regular copy ...
 * 	bcopy(ksp->ks_data, buf, sizeof (kstat_named_t) * ksp->ks_ndata);
 *
 * 	for (i = 0; i < ksp->ks_ndata; i++, knp++) {
 *		if (knp[i].data_type == KSTAT_DATA_STRING &&
 *		    KSTAT_NAMED_STR_PTR(knp) != NULL) {
 *			bcopy(KSTAT_NAMED_STR_PTR(knp), end,
 *			    KSTAT_NAMED_STR_BUFLEN(knp));
 *			KSTAT_NAMED_STR_PTR(knp) = end;
 *			end += KSTAT_NAMED_STR_BUFLEN(knp);
 *		}
 *	}

/*
 * Adding and deleting kstats.
 *
 * The typical sequence to add a kstat is:
 *
 *	ksp = kstat_create(module, instance, name, class, type, ndata, flags);
 *	if (ksp) {
 *		... provider initialization, if necessary
 *		kstat_install(ksp);
 *	}
 *
 * There are three logically distinct steps here:
 *
 * Step 1: System Initialization (kstat_create)
 *
 * kstat_create() performs system initialization.  kstat_create()
 * allocates memory for the entire kstat (header plus data), initializes
 * all header fields, initializes the data section to all zeroes, assigns
 * a unique KID, and puts the kstat onto the system's kstat chain.
 * The returned kstat is marked invalid (KSTAT_FLAG_INVALID is set),
 * because the provider (caller) has not yet had a chance to initialize
 * the data section.
 *
 * By default, kstats are exported to all zones on the system.  A kstat may be
 * created via kstat_create_zone() to specify a zone to which the statistics
 * should be exported.  kstat_zone_add() may be used to specify additional
 * zones to which the statistics are to be exported.
 *
 * Step 2: Provider Initialization
 *
 * The provider performs any necessary initialization of the data section,
 * e.g. setting the name fields in a KSTAT_TYPE_NAMED.  Virtual kstats set
 * the ks_data field at this time.  The provider may also set the ks_update,
 * ks_snapshot, ks_private, and ks_lock fields if necessary.
 *
 * Step 3: Installation (kstat_install)
 *
 * Once the kstat is completely initialized, kstat_install() clears the
 * INVALID flag, thus making the kstat accessible to the outside world.
 * kstat_install() also clears the DORMANT flag for persistent kstats.
 *
 * Removing a kstat from the system
 *
 * kstat_delete(ksp) removes ksp from the kstat chain and frees all
 * associated system resources.  NOTE: When you call kstat_delete(),
 * you must NOT be holding that kstat's ks_lock.  Otherwise, you may
 * deadlock with a kstat reader.
 *
 * Persistent kstats
 *
 * From the provider's point of view, persistence is transparent.  The only
 * difference between ephemeral (normal) kstats and persistent kstats
 * is that you pass KSTAT_FLAG_PERSISTENT to kstat_create().  Magically,
 * this has the effect of making your data visible even when you're
 * not home.  Persistence is important to tools like iostat, which want
 * to get a meaningful picture of disk activity.  Without persistence,
 * raw disk i/o statistics could never accumulate: they would come and
 * go with each open/close of the raw device.
 *
 * The magic of persistence works by slightly altering the behavior of
 * kstat_create() and kstat_delete().  The first call to kstat_create()
 * creates a new kstat, as usual.  However, kstat_delete() does not
 * actually delete the kstat: it performs one final update of the data
 * (i.e., calls the ks_update routine), marks the kstat as dormant, and
 * sets the ks_lock, ks_update, ks_private, and ks_snapshot fields back
 * to their default values (since they might otherwise point to garbage,
 * e.g. if the provider is going away).  kstat clients can still access
 * the dormant kstat just like a live kstat; they just continue to see
 * the final data values as long as the kstat remains dormant.
 * All subsequent kstat_create() calls simply find the already-existing,
 * dormant kstat and return a pointer to it, without altering any fields.
 * The provider then performs its usual initialization sequence, and
 * calls kstat_install().  kstat_install() uses the old data values to
 * initialize the native data (i.e., ks_update is called with KSTAT_WRITE),
 * thus making it seem like you were never gone.
