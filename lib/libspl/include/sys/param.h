 * The file system is made out of blocks of at most MAXBSIZE units,
 * with smaller units (fragments) only in the last direct block.
 * MAXBSIZE primarily determines the size of buffers in the buffer
 * pool. It may be made larger without any effect on existing
 * file systems; however making it smaller make make some file
 * systems unmountable.
 *
 * Note that the blocked devices are assumed to have DEV_BSIZE
 * "sectors" and that fragments must be some multiple of this size.
