<p>ZPIOS is benchmark designed to exercise the the ZFS Transaction
Object Layer.  It interfaces directly with the DMU just like the
ZPL, ZVOL, or Lustre interface layers.  Its purpose is to allow direct
measurement of DMU performance without the overhead, bottlenecks,
or other limitations which might exist in an one of the existing
interface layers.</p>

<p>The ZPIOS benchmark is packaged with the ZFS sources and is
built as part of the normal build process.  It consists of a kernel
module called <em>zpios.ko</em> and a command line utility called
<em>zpios</em>.  After the kernel module is loaded the <em>zpios</em>
command line utility is used to pass the test parameters to the
kernel module.  The test is then run entirely in the kernel and
the results reported back via the command line utility.</p>

<p>In addition, several wrapper scripts are provided to simplify
running a ZPIOS test.  The test script called <em>zpios.sh</em> takes
a prebuilt pool configuration and test description.  It then sets
up the pool launches the described test case and reports the results.
This provides a convenient way to survey multiple configurations and
workloads.</p>

<p>There are several sample pool configurations provided in the
<em>/usr/libexec/zfs/zpool-config/</em> directory.  There are also
several test workloads provided in the <em>/usr/libexec/zfs/zpios-test/</em>
directory.  To add you own configuration or test workload you should
use one of the samples as a template.  First copy it to a new file in
the proper directory and update it according to your requirements.</p>

<p>As an example, the following <em>zpios.sh</em> command will use the
<em>lo-raidz2</em> configuration to create a raidz2 pool using four
loopback devices.  It will then run the <em>tiny</em> test case and
report the read/write performance results.</p>

<pre>
$ sudo /usr/libexec/zfs/zpios.sh -c lo-raidz2 -t tiny 
status    name        id	wr-data	wr-ch	wr-bw	rd-data	rd-ch	rd-bw
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PASS:     lo-raidz2    0	64m	64	203.09m	64m	64	1.25g
</pre>

<p><b>Be careful</b> about running a sample pool configuration without
looking at the script to see what it does.  Many of the configurations
use loopback devices, scsi_debug devices, or temporarily files for the
pool.  These are all very safe to run.  However others operate by
default on real block devices, you must ensure these devices are not
in use on your system or they will be overwritten.</p>
